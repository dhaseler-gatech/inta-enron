# inta-enron

This is a group project aimed at finding evidence of wrongdoing in the Enron dataset for the course INTA6450.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/inta-enron.git
    ```

2. Download the dataset by visiting the following link:
    [Enron Mail Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tar.gz)

3. Move the downloaded `.tar.gz` file to the same directory where you cloned the repository, alongside `main.py`.

4. The initial run will take longer as it unzips the dataset and creates the necessary data frames. Once this process is complete, subsequent runs will be faster.

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply execute the `main.py` script:
```bash
python main.py
