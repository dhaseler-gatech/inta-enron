FULL EMAIL BODY:
A significant number of our merchant investments are owned in whole or in 
part through various structured finance vehicles.  Amendments, 
restructurings, dispositions, follow-on investments and other significant 
transactions related to those assets may be prohibited or may require 
internal or external consents.  As the commercial teams may not always be 
familiar with these vehicles or the special considerations that may apply to 
these vehicles, you may want to confirm with the attorney/legal assistant 
that is most familiar with the particular vehicle that (i) the appropriate 
people are "in the loop" with what you are doing with the asset, and (ii) 
that there won't be any unpleasant surprises (like a required consent that 
has not been obtained) five minutes before you are supposed to close whatever 
transaction you are working on.

The contacts for the most active vehicles are:  

JEDI - Jordan Mintz
JEDI II -- Joel Ephross, Shirley Hudler
Raptor and Trutta -- Joel Ephross, Lisa Mellencamp, Mary Cook
Merlin -- Anne Koehler 
Rawhide -- Mary Heinitz, Brenda Funk
Hawaii -- Gareth Bahlmann

In addition, please make sure that Shirley Hudler is aware of any significant 
pending transaction involving a JEDI II asset.  With respect to new deals, I 
understand that the JEDI II commitment period has been extended to June 30, 
2001, and that as a result ENA will still have an obligation to place 
"qualified investments" in JEDI II.  While EGF will have a good handle on the 
funding source for your deal, in the early stages the commercial team is not 
always aware that JEDI II is still out there.  Again, if you have any 
questions, please contact Shirley Hudler.

The electricity rate hike proposed Monday by the state's top utility=20

local business leaders.=20
"This is a regrettable necessity," said Justin Bradley, energy program=20

Gray Davis has adamantly rejected calls for further rate hikes. But Public=
=20
Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, signaled=
=20
that the administration may be ready to retreat with a plan to hike the=20
average retail price by 3 cents a kilowatt hour. That would be a 46 percent=
=20
increase over the current average rate in the PG&E service area of 6.4 cent=
s=20

to power procurement.=20
That didn't faze Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of=20
Commerce. "We have looked at it as inevitable for some time," he said of th=
e=20
rate hike. Higher natural gas costs, along with the dry winter that reduced=
=20
the availability of hydroelectric power throughout the West, were bound to=

Bradley, speaking for tech manufacturers, said Lynch's plan promises to ste=
m=20
the tide of state agency spending on electricity, direct some revenue towar=

small generators and put some downward pressure on wholesale prices but is=
=20
only one step toward a long-term solution. "We need an overall philosophy a=

strategy to restore normalcy to this market," he said.=20
Lynch, who described her offering as "merely a proposal to jumpstart the=20
public process of rate design," included as a "principle" plans to narrow t=

gap between residential rates and those of industrial users, whose average=
=20
bill now logs in at about 3 cents a kilowatt hour less. Lynch suggested tha=
t=20
that differential be shaved by about a penny an hour.=20
That isn't the direction that Kern would like to see things move. "Our main=

concern would be that if there is a rate increase it be (done) equitably an=

But rate hikes promise to remove the cloud of debt -- billions of dollars=

largest electricity seller, closed at $14.55, up $3.35 or 29.9 percent.=20
Edison issued a late-day response to Lynch's move that seemed designed to=

Dan Walters: An absolutely incredible tale


(Published March 27, 2001)=20
From the onset of his governorship two-plus years ago, Gray Davis has=20
insisted, by both public words and private acts, that he and he alone would=
=20
make his administration's major policy decisions.=20
Legislators and lobbyists have complained that no one in Davis' office was=
=20
empowered to give an up or down signal on pending legislation, and=20
administration officials have recounted grimly - and very privately - tales=
=20
about Davis' insistence on deciding even minuscule policy matters. The=20
governor once castigated one of his Cabinet appointees before her colleague=
s=20
in the harshest possible language for making an environmental policy change=
=20
without his approval. The most routine action by a state agency is trumpete=
d=20
through the governor's media office. Davis has even joked about his=20
micromanagerial tendencies.=20
It is, therefore, utterly incredible - in the precise meaning of the word -=
=20
that Davis' handpicked president of the state Public Utilities Commission, =
a=20
former political adviser, would raise electric power rates by billions of=
=20
dollars without clearing it through Davis. Yet that's what the governor's=
=20
mouthpiece asserts.=20
On Monday, PUC President Loretta Lynch - acknowledging what anyone with hal=
f=20
a brain knew weeks ago - declared that power rates would have to jump=20
sharply. She is proposing an increase of three cents a kilowatt-hour, about=
=20
40 percent, in areas served by private utilities to cover the massive costs=
=20
associated with the current crisis, with a "tiered" structure to impose mos=
t=20
of the burden on high- volume power users.=20
Even Lynch was fudging, however, when she insisted that the boost - from=20
about seven cents a kilowatt-hour to 10 cents - would be "all that is neede=
d=20
going forward." In fact, as anyone who can do simple arithmetic can=20
calculate, it's only the beginning of a series of rate jumps that will be=
=20
needed to cover past debts and current wholesale costs. It's not improbable=
=20
that ultimately, rates will double (not counting another nickel a=20
kilowatt-hour that's imposed for delivery and other costs).=20
Lynch's public statement came just three days after Davis' aides briefed ke=
y=20
legislators on the likelihood of sharp rate boosts. Throughout, however,=20
Davis' spokesmen have insisted that the governor was not supporting such=20
increases and continues to believe that the supply and price crunches can b=
e=20
handled "within the existing rate structure," as one euphemistic version pu=
t=20
it.=20
The latest spin was issued by Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, after=
=20
Lynch's statement. "The governor has not had conversations with any (utilit=
y)=20
commissioners about a potential rate hike," the Maviglio statement said. "I=
t=20
is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved within t=
he=20
existing rate structure."=20
Clearly, the governor, who has been so insistent on doing things his way - =
a=20
tendency bordering on obsessive-compulsive behavior - has gone into the=20
bunker on this one, allowing Lynch to take the heat from consumer groups,=
=20
which immediately denounced the proposed rate increase as a giveaway to the=
=20
utilities.=20
It's cowardly, especially because the current crisis is largely a product o=
f=20
dithering by Davis and Lynch last summer when the first price-supply proble=
ms=20
appeared. Had they acted forthrightly then, with such steps as long-term=20
supply contracts, it would have been a relatively minor bump rather than a=
=20
full-blown disaster that threatens the state's business climate and its=20
solvency and will cause financial pain for Californians.=20
If California needs a utility rate increase, so be it. But we Californians=
=20
would appreciate not being treated like children who need sugarcoating for=
=20
the bad-tasting medicine. And we'd also appreciate not having our=20
intelligence insulted with fairy tales from the Governor's Office.=20

Daniel Weintraub: No crisis is big enough to slow Davis' fund spree=20


(Published March 27, 2001)=20
If Gov. Gray Davis' potential opponents wanted to invent an anecdote to use=

against him when he runs for re-election next year, they couldn't do any=20
better than the one he handed them Friday.=20
While lawmakers desperately in need of leadership deadlocked on crucial=20
legislation to help solve California's energy crisis, Davis was at a Palm=

committee's already record-shattering $26 million bank balance.=20
The governor's spokesman assures us that Davis did not actually play golf=

interview.=20
Right. Davis may have been in Palm Springs on state business, but it's=20
curious that, wherever he goes, this governor always seems to find a way to=

raise some money. Even if he didn't play golf, the incident drives home the=

image of a governor so preoccupied with his own re-election that he can't=

While Davis was rubbing shoulders with wealthy supporters in the desert, hi=

fantasy. Rates will have to rise, perhaps double, to get us out of this,=20
according to the governor's staff. You cannot forever buy a dollar's worth =

This is incredible stuff, especially coming from the governor's own people.=

But what's even more astounding is that this news was delivered to the=20

=20
Davis is not only out of town, it turns out. He's out of touch. Of course, =
we=20

Last week, to put it mildly, was a bad one for the governor, whom critics=

have begun to call the prince of darkness. It began with two days of rollin=
g=20
blackouts that would not have happened but for Davis' inattention to a=20
problem that threatened to shut down between 10 percent and 20 percent of t=
he=20
state's already short power supply. Alternative energy producers, including=
=20
cogeneration plants that produce electricity as a byproduct of a=20
manufacturing operation, were going dark because they weren't getting paid=
=20
for their electricity and could no longer afford to buy the fuel that fires=
=20
their plants.=20
It has been widely known for months that the utilities weren't paying these=
=20
power producers. The Legislature has been working on a measure to get them=
=20
paid and lower their rates by roughly half. It's a very important part of a=
ny=20
comprehensive solution to the crisis. But after the blackouts hit, Davis=20
acted as if he'd only just discovered the problem. He was outraged. He said=
=20
it was "immoral" for the utilities to collect money from ratepayers and not=

But that was only the beginning. The battle over getting the small energy=

=20
power purchases Davis has been making since January on behalf of the=20
utilities. Davis intends to float a bond measure - public borrowing - to=20

to put the state, and its bond partners, at the front of the line for the=

Energy woes give nuclear plants a life=20




Crisis offers second chance to all-but-discarded industry
By Bruce Lieberman=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
March 26, 2001=20
A group of nuclear power advocates and energy experts gathered in an=20
auditorium in Irvine last month to discuss "Nuclear Power: The Option for t=
he=20
21st century?"=20
Their talk was upbeat.=20
Even asking that question would have been laughable five years ago.=20
In 1996, California was heading toward a deregulated electricity market. Th=
e=20
commercial nuclear power industry was heading toward extinction.=20
No way could it compete with coal and natural gas fired plants in a=20
deregulated market. Never would a utility invest billions of dollars to bui=
ld=20
a nuclear power plant when it had no guarantee of recovering that investmen=
t=20
through customer rates, which the architects of deregulation said would onl=
y=20
fall.=20
No one had ordered a nuclear power plant in this country since 1978, the ye=
ar=20
before a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant and eight years=20
before a nuclear reactor blew up at Chernobyl.=20
Political support for nuclear power was all but dead, and electric utilitie=
s=20
in the United States knew it.=20
That was then.=20
Today, the country's nuclear power industry is looking at California's=20
troubled experiment with electricity deregulation, environmental concerns=
=20
over global warming and an unyielding demand for electricity -- and they se=
e=20
one thing:=20
Opportunity.=20
"I'm extremely optimistic about the future of nuclear power in the U.S.,"=
=20
Corbin A. McNeill, Jr., chairman and co-chief executive officer of utility=
=20
giant Exelon Corp., told the Irvine symposium.=20
Nuclear power advocates across the country say the industry is safer, more=
=20
efficient and more economically viable than ever before.=20
"I personally believe there will be a new generation of nuclear power plant=
s=20
in this country," said Ray Golden, a spokesman for Southern California=20
Edison's nuclear power plant at San Onofre. "It's a function of when."=20
Late last month, Senate Republicans introduced an energy bill that could le=
ad=20
to more nuclear power plants.=20
The National Energy Security Act, introduced by Sen. Frank Murkowski of=20
Alaska, would give a big boost to the industry. It would provide nearly $1=
=20
billion in research and development money, financial rewards for operators=
=20
who make nuclear power plants more efficient, and industrywide tax breaks.=
=20
Critics say the bill would just give taxpayer support to a dying industry.=
=20
"Clamoring for new subsidies doesn't help the industry make the case that i=
t=20
is now economically competitive and poised for a resurgence," said=20
Christopher Sherry, research director for the Safe Energy Communication=20
Council, a coalition of environmental groups founded after the 1979 acciden=
t=20
at Three Mile Island.
New lease on life
Two primary changes in the nuclear power industry have given advocates reas=
on=20
to be optimistic.=20
First, commercial power plants have become more efficient.=20
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry-backed trade association in=20
Washington, estimates that improvements in output at the nation's 103=20
commercial nuclear reactors have added the equivalent of about 25 1,000=20
megawatt-reactors.=20
The industry, matured by decades of experience, has improved safety and=20
shortened routine shutdowns for refueling and maintenance. Electricity=20
production costs are at an all-time low, at 1.83 cents per kilowatt-hour=20
(down from 3.12 cents in 1987), making nuclear energy competitive with coal=
=20
and natural gas, according to the institute.=20
Second, the federal government has begun extending operating licenses for=
=20
nuclear reactors.=20
Since last March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has extended the 40-yea=
r=20
operating licenses for five reactors an additional 20 years. The operators =
of=20
five more reactors have applied for license extensions, and an additional 2=
8=20
are expected to seek extensions within the next five years, the institute=
=20
said.=20
Southern California Edison has not decided whether it will seek a license=
=20
extension for San Onofre's two remaining reactors, Units 2 and 3, Golden=20
said. Both are scheduled to be shut down in 2022.=20
In those reactors that obtain license extensions, utilities see new value,=
=20
and a profitable future.=20
Environmentalists see an avoidable danger.=20
Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's consumer advocate group, has called extending=
 a=20
nuclear power plant's license a "high-stakes gamble" that risks safety in=
=20
aging plants.=20
Critical components in a nuclear power plant, including the reactor pressur=
e=20
vessel that holds nuclear fuel and the thousands of steam generator tubes=
=20
that circulate heated and irradiated water, endure extreme stresses and=20
degrade over time.=20
"There was a reason (the nation's nuclear power plants) originally had=20
40-year licenses," said Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe Energy=
=20
Communication Council.=20
New sales, new worries
With license extensions, nuclear power plants are now seen by buyers as=20
profit centers. Six commercial nuclear reactors have been sold since=20
mid-1999, and the sale of eight reactors is pending, according to the Nucle=
ar=20
Energy Institute.=20
The merger of several big utilities has consolidated ownership of commercia=
l=20
nuclear reactors. The marriage of Commonwealth Edison-Unicom in Illinois an=
d=20
PECO Energy Co. in Pennsylvania in October created Exelon Corp. and placed =
17=20
reactors under one corporate roof.=20
McNeill, of Exelon, said the consolidation is creating tremendous economies=
=20
of scale that are bringing down operating costs.=20
Critics worry about a new rivalry between utilities that operate the plants=
.=20
"Electricity deregulation sets up a direct competition between power plants=
,=20
potentially compromising the safe operation of nuclear power plants as owne=
rs=20
attempt to minimize operation and maintenance costs while maximizing=20
electricity production and sales," Public Citizen has written.=20
The environmental group argues that a Feb. 3 electrical fire in the turbine=
=20
room of San Onofre's Unit 3 reactor, which occurred as workers were=20
re-starting the reactor after a routine refueling and maintenance outage,=
=20
shows that the industry is not as reliable as advocates would like the publ=
ic=20
to believe. Damage caused by the failed circuit breaker that caused the fir=
e=20
will keep the 1,100-megawatt reactor shut down through mid-May.=20
"The NRC and the nuclear industry have been skimping on maintenance during=
=20
refueling to improve the profitability of nuclear reactors," said Public=20
Citizen's Jim Riccio, senior policy analyst for the group's Critical Mass=
=20
Energy and Environment Program.=20
Yet, according to reports the company filed Feb. 16 with the Securities and=
=20
Exchange Commission, Southern California Edison, the majority owner of the=
=20
San Onofre plant, will lose between $80 million and $100 million because of=
=20
the Feb. 3 fire.=20
That comes at a rough time for the cash-strapped utility.=20
The San Onofre nuclear power plant is the company's most important asset at=
 a=20
time when it is near bankruptcy because of skyrocketing electricity costs=
=20
from out-of-state power generators.=20
"San Onofre is the only thing that makes the company money," Golden said.
State's nuclear future
California, the most populous state in the country and the world's sixth=20
largest economy, has four nuclear reactors -- two at San Onofre and two at=
=20
the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo. Yet, those four=
=20
nuclear reactors generate more than 4,000 megawatts of electricity, nearly =
18=20
percent of the electricity generated in California.=20
A third plant, Rancho Seco, near Sacramento, was shut down in 1989 when=20
voters demanded its closure. Opponents said it was badly run.=20
Yet, so desperate are state legislators to find sources of power that at=20
least one has discussed turning Rancho Seco back on. On Feb. 22, state Sen.=
=20
Tom McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, introduced a bill to study whether the sta=
te=20
should buy Rancho Seco.=20
McClintock said the plant could be put back into service in nine months for=
=20
$500 million. And, with new turbines, the plant could increase its producti=
on=20
of electricity from 800 megawatts to 1,100 megawatts -- enough power for mo=
re=20
than a million people.=20
McClintock acknowledges there is little enthusiasm in the state Legislature=
=20
for embracing nuclear energy as one answer to California's energy crisis.=
=20
"Politically, they're scared to death of it," he said.=20
John. P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's John F.=
=20
Kennedy School of Government, said the high cost of building nuclear power=
=20
plants likely will keep the industry from expanding in the short term.=20
In the longer term, though, Holdren said nuclear energy could offer a real=
=20
alternative to fossil fuels and thereby help combat global warming.=20
In testimony to Congress last June, he outlined several conditions that mus=
t=20
be met before the nuclear energy production can expand. Among them were som=
e=20
high hurdles:=20
?The industry must become competitive with other alternative energy sources=
=20
that do not emit carbon into the atmosphere, such as hydro-electric power.=
=20
?Nuclear power plants around the world must prove they are safe.=20
?The nation must find a permanent repository for nuclear waste and build=20
temporary storage facilities until one opens.=20
?Research into reprocessing used nuclear fuel, which produces a form of=20
plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons, should be suspended.=20
?Nuclear energy must gain widespread public acceptance.=20
New breed=20
If any power company debuts the next generation of nuclear power plants in=
=20
the United States, it may very well be Exelon Corp.=20
The company is helping to finance research in South Africa into a new type =
of=20
nuclear reactor, called the "pebble bed modular reactor." The 110-megawatt=
=20
reactor, about a tenth the size of conventional nuclear reactors in the=20
United States, would be designed to eliminate the risk of a meltdown, backe=
rs=20
say.=20
Passive safety features would eliminate the need for redundant back-up=20
systems, containment structures and off-site emergency plants, drastically=
=20
cutting costs. Because of their modular design, additional reactors could b=
e=20
added at a single site. McNeill said the new technology could be imported t=
o=20
the United States and Europe within the next few years.=20
"A typical plant should be able to generate a kilowatt of electricity for=
=20
less than a penny," he said.=20
Environmental groups have been extremely critical of the design, saying tha=
t=20
it needs some type of containment structure, such as the concrete domes at=
=20
San Onofre, to keep radiation from escaping into the atmosphere should=20
disaster strike.=20
Meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved three designs for=
=20
other, more conventional reactors.=20
McClintock said it's only a matter of time before politicians and the publi=
c=20
re-think their positions on nuclear energy.=20
The legislator predicts that a shift in opinions will come this summer, whe=
n=20
projections by the California Independent System Operator show that=20
electricity supply shortages will force blackouts on 6 million people.=20
"By the time the state has survived the summer of 2001," McClintock said, "=
as=20
a practical matter, we'll be forced to take a new look at nuclear energy.=
=20

Top state power regulator proposes 40 percent rate increase=20




By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
March 26, 2001=20
SAN FRANCISCO =01) California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent h=
ike=20
in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage=20
customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the=
=20
hot summer months.=20
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates=20
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rat=
e=20
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour.=20
The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC=20
meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the=20
commission.=20
Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent=20
increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems=
=20
this summer.=20
"That number should be all that is needed going forward," she said at a new=
s=20
conference, "to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of the=
=20
state can issue bonds."=20
Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine=
=20
Walwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary=
.=20
Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase t=
he=20
PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already=20
scheduled for next year.=20
Lynch also supports a "tiered" rate system that would charge residential an=
d=20
businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back, a mo=
ve=20
aimed at encouraging conservation.=20
The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis c=
an=20
be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that=
=20
rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several=20
lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate=20
increase is inevitable.=20
"It's obvious to me that unless you rob a bank or win a lottery you are not=
=20
going to be able to do this without raising rates," Senate President Pro Te=
m=20
John Burton, D-San Francisco, said Monday.=20
Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have=20
pushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates woul=

Administration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San=20

PUC to Vote on Big Rate Hike; OK Is Likely=20

Electricity: Agency chief urges a boost of about 40% for many, and calls it=
=20
necessary to raise cash and encourage conservation. Higher cost could show =
up=20
in May bills.=20

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Millions of Californians would see electricity rates ri=
se=20
by about 40% under a plan presented Monday by the state's top power regulat=
or.
?????Loretta Lynch, president of California's Public Utilities Commission,=
=20
called rate hikes necessary both to raise cash and to encourage conservatio=
n.
?????Her plan would charge some customers of the state's two biggest privat=
e=20
utilities 3 cents more per kilowatt-hour, depending on how much electricity=
=20
they consume. The higher cost would show up in May power bills.
?????Lynch promised to target the increases on heavy users of electricity a=
nd=20
spare nearly half of residential customers from paying more. The commission=
=20
is scheduled to vote on her proposal today, and it is almost certain to win=
=20
approval, according to commissioners.=20
?????It would cost customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas =
&=20
Electric a total of $4.8 billion a year.=20
?????San Diego Gas & Electric is not covered by the proposed rate hikes,=20
though officials there said their utility should be.
?????Nor would the increases affect the customers of municipally owned=20
utilities in Los Angeles, Riverside, Pasadena, Anaheim and elsewhere.
?????Lynch's proposal drew fire from consumer advocates, sighs of resignati=
on=20
from lawmakers and enthusiasm from Wall Street. Stock prices for both=20
companies jumped by nearly one-third.
?????For renters and homeowners, the proposal could cost nothing or as much=
=20
as 40% more per month. Business customers--who now pay lower rates--could s=
ee=20
even higher increases.
?????The latest proposed increase would come on top of an average 10% rate=
=20
hike for all users imposed in January, which would become permanent under=
=20
Lynch's plan. An additional 10% increase for residential and small business=
=20
users is already scheduled for this time next year.
?????"We recognize the utilities are in severe financial distress," Lynch=
=20
said. "For utilities to keep the lights on, we unfortunately came to the=20
conclusion a rate increase was needed."
?????Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, recently appointed by Davis, predicted th=
at=20
the plan will pass. Commissioner Richard Bilas, a Republican appointed by=
=20
former Gov. Pete Wilson, would not say whether he would vote for Lynch's=20
proposal but said "rates need to go up."
?????Davis, who named three of the five commissioners, distanced himself=20
Monday from the PUC action, saying that it's an independent body. He repeat=
ed=20
that it is his expectation that rate increases can be avoided.
?????"I've not seen enough information to persuade me we need a rate hike,"=
=20
the governor said at a news conference after speaking to students at Walt=
=20
Disney Elementary School in Burbank.
?????If the increase is approved today, Lynch said, it will be refined in t=
he=20
30 days it takes the utilities to change their billing processes. The rate=
=20
increase would be subject to refund if it is more than enough to cover cost=
s=20
of energy purchases.
?????Lynch said she cannot finalize the proposal until she gets more=20
information about power supply and cost projections from the California=20
Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of=
=20
the nearly bankrupt utilities in mid-January. That's when some generators=
=20
refused to sell to the utilities for fear of not getting paid.

?????Utilities Earned Substantial Profits
?????The utilities have been burdened by wholesale electricity prices that=
=20
have topped 10 times the levels of those a year ago.
?????Rising demand for electricity across the West, plus fundamental flaws =
in=20
the design of the deregulated market that California opened in 1998, have=
=20
allowed sellers of electricity to earn substantial profits. Since the state=
=20
stepped in to buy electricity for the utilities, it has spent about $3=20
billion covering roughly 34% of the state's power needs.
?????While Davis has adamantly resisted rate hikes, other politicians have=
=20
come to call increases inevitable. The state and utilities need a better ca=
sh=20
flow to cover wholesale power costs expected to soar again this summer, the=
y=20
say.
?????And rate boosts will serve another critical purpose, they say, by=20
prompting Californians to switch off lights, buy efficient refrigerators an=
d=20
shut down hot tubs. Such conservation will be crucial in whether the state=
=20
avoids blackouts, grid operators say.
?????"If it is tiered right, it wouldn't break my heart," Senate President=
=20
Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said, adding that he expects that any=
=20
increase will exempt low-income people.
?????Lynch said repeatedly that the 3-cent-per-kilowatt-hour hike she=20
proposed should be all that is necessary to allow the state and utilities t=
o=20
keep buying electricity. The more than $13 billion the utilities claim they=
=20
are owed for power purchases since May must be resolved through negotiation=
s=20
between the governor's office and the utilities, she said.
?????The Legislature already has approved a bill guaranteeing that those wh=
o=20
use 30% more than their minimal allocation, known as the baseline, won't fe=
el=20
the hikes.
?????The baseline is a certain amount of electricity--50% to 60% of the=20
average residential use per month--that varies regionally, so that a=20
homeowner in the desert has a higher baseline amount than one living on the=
=20
temperate coast. Electricity consumed up to the baseline amount costs less.
?????Last year, Edison customers paid 6.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for=20
electricity. (The average home uses about 700 to 1,000 kilowatt-hours per=
=20
month.) The PUC raised that rate to 7.2 cents in January, and Lynch's=20
proposal would boost it to 10.2 cents.
?????Edison customers also pay an additional 5.25 cents for distribution,=
=20
billing and other costs on top of the electricity charge.
?????Lynch projects that under her plan about half of Edison's households=
=20
would have no monthly bill increases, one-fifth would have an 8% increase,=
=20
and fewer than about one-third of the households would have a 27% increase.
?????Rather than welcome the potential rate hikes, Edison officials said th=
ey=20
were frustrated that the PUC proposal does not guarantee that the higher=20
rates will cover all of the utility's and the state's costs.
?????"It helps, but it doesn't solve the problem," said John R. Fielder, a=
=20
senior vice president at Edison. "And it's really vulnerable because if it'=
s=20
not enough, then what do you do?"
?????Fielder pointed out that when Edison argued for higher rates in=20
December, it was turned down, causing the utility to accumulate additional=
=20
billions in debt. Monday's PUC proposal treats that debt as a "stranded=20
cost," which the utility could eventually be expected to absorb, he said.
?????In a two-hour hearing on Lynch's proposal, PG&E lawyer Chris Warner=20
called it a "a step in the right direction."
?????"We agree with President Lynch that it's time to pay the power bills,"=
=20
he said. Warner declined to elaborate until the utility could study the=20
proposal further.
?????Consumer groups immediately attacked the rate hike proposal.
?????Jason Zeller, an attorney with the PUC's independent Office of Ratepay=
er=20
Advocates, complained that "customers had no notice that they would be sock=
ed=20
with the largest rate increase in California history."
?????"My big concern . . . is it imposes massive increases, damages the=20
economy, and there is no guarantee it would do any good," Zeller said.
?????Bob Finkelstein of the Utility Reform Network said: "The focus [of the=
=20
PUC] should be to bring prices down, not rates up."
?????Power sellers in California's market have "an uncanny ability to sniff=
=20
out money," Finkelstein said, and the Lynch proposal "only puts more on the=
=20
table."
?????Lynch blamed the need for rate hikes on exorbitant prices for wholesal=
e=20
electricity, noting that California paid $7.4 billion for electricity in al=
l=20
of 1999, and $5.2 billion last January. She also blamed the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission for failing to impose a cap on wholesale electricity=
=20
prices in California, despite its mandate under federal law to assure=20
citizens of "just and reasonable" prices.
?????To plug the $3-billion hole in the state budget and pay for power in=
=20
coming months, lawmakers in February passed a law to sell roughly $10 billi=
on=20
in revenue bonds. The bonds would be paid back with money collected by the=
=20
utilities from their customers.
?????In recent weeks the utilities have argued that little or nothing is le=
ft=20
over after they subtract their own costs of producing and distributing powe=
r=20
from what they collect from monthly bills.
?????But on Monday, Lynch issued a draft decision that would force the=20
utilities to send ratepayer revenue to the state based on a formula set by=
=20
the PUC.
?????Representatives of both PG&E and Edison criticized that proposal at=20
Monday's hearing, saying it gave priority to the state Department of Water=
=20
Resources.
?????Lynch also proposed forcing the utilities to begin paying hundreds of=
=20
small energy producers. Some of those renewable and alternative power=20
generators have not been paid since November. Many have shut down, and thei=
r=20
lost output contributed to rotating blackouts last week.
?????The potential rate hikes were seen as lessening the possibility of=20
utility bankruptcy. That sent investors diving into the stocks of Edison=20
International, parent of Southern California Edison, and PG&E Corp, parent =
of=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
?????Edison rocketed $3.35, or 30%, to $14.55 while PG&E shares leaped $3.1=
0,=20
or 29%, to $13.75. Both stocks have lost considerable value in recent weeks=
=20
as the electricity crisis dragged on with no solution.
?????Investors were not discouraged by PG&E's warning that it might take a=
=20
$4.1-billion after-tax charge against 2000 earnings if it concludes that it=
=20
will not be able to collect its electricity debts through rates. Edison las=

?????Well. It all depends on what your definition of "cost" is. The ISO=20

Undermining Gov. Gray Davis' pledge that electricity bills will not go up,=
=20
state regulators yesterday proposed an across-the-board 40 percent rate=20
increase as part of a series of measures to remedy California's energy=20
crisis.=20
The immediate rate increase, to be voted on today by the Public Utilities=
=20
Commission, includes a new 30 percent increase and makes permanent a=20
"temporary" 10 percent average increase approved in January.=20
However, heavier electricity users would end up paying more than lighter=20
users under a so-called tiered system that could be enacted by May, PUC=20
President Loretta Lynch said.=20
"It's time to pay the power bills for California," she said. "We have=20
unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is needed."=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, insisted that Davis played no=
=20
role in the decision to raise consumers' rates.=20
"He has not signed off on this," Maviglio said. "The PUC is an independent=
=20
body. It does what it wants."=20
However, Maviglio acknowledged that the PUC is controlled by Davis'=20
appointees and that the governor's staff was briefed in advance of=20
yesterday's announcement.=20
Lynch said she does not expect further rate increases this year. But she al=
so=20
said the situation could change depending on current bailout negotiations=
=20
between the governor and near-bankrupt utilities as well as the state's=20
ability to recoup costs from its multibillion-dollar power purchases.=20
Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said=20
there is no way state officials can avoid additional rate increases after=
=20
confronting sky-high electricity prices this summer.=20
"It's a disaster," he said. "By the end of summer, rates will go up by 100=
=20
percent. They have to because these new increases will barely pay back the=
=20
state for its power purchases."=20
Snyder also criticized the governor for having insisted that consumers woul=
d=20
not be saddled with paying the tab for the bungled deregulation of=20
California's power market.=20
Davis has said repeatedly in recent weeks that rates would not need to rise=
=20
beyond "the existing rate structure," which many observers took to mean=20
January's 10 percent increase plus an additional 10 percent increase next=
=20
year.=20
"It's the Nixon, trust-me school of government," Snyder said. "How can we=
=20
take the governor at his word?"=20
Because Lynch and other Democratic appointees hold a majority on the five-=
=20
member PUC, passage of the rate increase today is all but assured.=20
However, Lynch said consumers probably would not see the change reflected i=
n=20
their bills until a tiered rate system can be introduced within 45 days.=20
Under that system, according to PUC figures, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=
=20
customers who are light power users would see no change from current averag=
e=20
electricity bills of $60.=20
Medium users -- those who stay within 200 percent of pre-established limits=
=20
-- would see average bills rise by 9 percent to about $65. Heavy users woul=
d=20
see average bills jump by 36 percent to around $132.=20
Rate increases for customers of Southern California Edison would range from=
 8=20
percent for medium users to 27 percent for heavy users.=20
These increases would be on top of January's rate increases, which ranged=
=20
from 9 percent for residential customers to 15 percent for large industrial=
=20
users.=20
Investors saw this as manna from heaven for California's cash-strapped=20
utilities. PG&E's stock soared 29 percent yesterday to $13.75, while Edison=
's=20
shares climbed 30 percent $14.55.=20
The increase would generate about $2.5 billion a year for PG&E and $2.3=20
billion for Edison.=20
Yet many uncertainties remain. For example, the rate increase would not=20
affect about $13 billion in debt racked up by the utilities as a result of=
=20
runaway wholesale power prices.=20
That issue will be left for the governor to tackle in his bailout talks.=20
Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said yesterday that the negotiations are making=
=20
progress, but he could not say whether a deal at last is taking shape.=20
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PLANTS
Another wild card is the matter of alternative-energy providers, which have=
=20
cut back production in recent days because they no longer can pay their=20
natural gas bills.=20
The companies -- known as "qualifying facilities" or "QFs" in industry=20
parlance -- say they are owed millions of dollars by PG&E and Edison.=20
The PUC will vote today on forcing the utilities to pay the alternative=20
energy providers for all power received, but only on a forward-looking basi=
s.=20
Past debt would not have to be paid right away.=20
It remains to be seen whether the qualifying facilities, half of which were=
=20
shut down during last week's blackouts, will be able to resume operations.=
=20
"We cannot direct the gas suppliers to sell to them," admitted PUC member=
=20
Carl Wood.=20
The commission also is expected to vote today on requiring PG&E and Edison =
to=20
repay about $4 billion paid by the state Department of Water Resources to=
=20
purchase electricity for the utilities' customers.=20
However, it is not yet clear how revenue from ratepayers will be divvied up=
=20
in the future. The utilities and the Department of Water Resources are at=
=20
odds over which would get first crack at the funds to cover expenses.=20
BLAME GOES TO PROFITEERS
Lynch, the PUC president, laid blame for California's troubles on profit-=
=20
hungry power companies that she said have gouged the state's consumers, as=
=20
well as on a reluctance among federal regulators to limit how much generato=
rs=20
can charge for electricity.=20
"The federal market cops need to get back on the beat because they're nowhe=
re=20
to be found," she said.=20
A spokeswoman for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D=
.=20
C., declined to comment.=20
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San=20
Francisco, questioned the wisdom of raising consumers' rates as long as=20
wholesale prices remain unchecked, especially going into a summer of expect=
ed=20
shortages.=20
"Neither the commission nor the governor are willing to say no to the carte=
l=20
that is gouging us and extracting obscene profits," she said. "Every time w=
e=20
put a burden on ratepayers and ask them to dig deeper in their pockets,=20
the cartel smells money and moves in for the kill."=20
Lynch stressed that the burden on ratepayers would be eased under a tiered=
=20
system that she said would promote conservation.=20
'HOGS' WILL BE SLAUGHTERED=20
"Electricity hogs will need to pay more," she said. "If you want to run you=
r=20
pool pump during peak hours this summer, you will pay for that."=20
Tiered rates have found support virtually across the spectrum, from the=20
governor's office to consumer watchdogs. The PUC is expected to have no=20
difficulty adopting such a system.=20
But Snyder at Consumers Union took issue with Lynch's characterization of=
=20
higher rates as a conservation tool.=20
"That's total bull," he said. "She's just trying to rationalize the increas=
e=20
by saying it's all the consumer's fault.=20
"The governor said there would be a sharing of pain," Snyder added. "This=
=20
isn't sharing. This is nothing but pain for consumers."=20
The Agenda=20
Regulators will vote today on:=20
-- Immediately raising electricity rates 30 percent and making permanent a=
=20
"temporary" 10 percent rate increase adopted in January.=20
-- Forcing utilities to pay smaller power companies for their output. Half =
of=20
such generators were shut down during last week's blackouts because they=20
could not afford fuel.=20
-- Requiring utilities to reimburse the state Department of Water Resources=
=20
for $4 billion in power purchased on behalf of utility customers.=20

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis clung yesterday to his expectation that energ=
y=20
rates won't have to go up and insisted that he didn't know one of his top=
=20
political appointees would propose a 40 percent increase.=20
Those comments drew shaking heads from many lawmakers, both Republicans and=
=20
Democrats, who believe that the governor was an active participant in the=
=20
plan announced by the head of the Public Utilities Commission.=20
"I don't believe it," said Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough. "I think the=
=20
governor has been real clear from day one how he views everyone else in sta=
te=20
government. He certainly believes his appointees should reflect his vision.=
=20
I'd be very surprised if he isn't communicating. And if he isn't, he should=
=20
be. "=20
Political observers say Davis may have thought he had found a political out=
=20
by having the commission -- which is accustomed to making unpopular decisio=
ns=20
- - take the lead on raising rates.=20
But the strategy could backfire as lawmakers from both parties say the=20
governor's refusal to acknowledge the necessity of rate increases -- a=20
position held by even his top advisers -- is making the energy crisis worse=
.=20
Pollster Mark DiCamillo of the Field Institute said Davis is making a=20
political calculation by keeping to his word on not needing rate increases.=
=20
"I think it may be a public posture he wants to consistently maintain -- he=
=20
may not prevail -- but they may have to drag him kicking and screaming to=
=20
raise rates," DiCamillo said. "But if his will is not carrying the day, he=
=20
may be seen as powerless and that could drag him down."=20
While PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch announced that that rates will probably =
go=20
up 40 percent, Davis stayed far away from the firestorm enveloping the=20
Capitol, instead handing out academic performance bonuses at a school in=20
Southern California.=20
The governor has often tried to have it both ways with the PUC. Last week h=
e=20
held a press conference to say he was going to direct the commission to act=
=20
on a plan to bail out alternative power generators. Yet yesterday a spokesm=
an=20
insisted Davis knew nothing of Lynch's plans to propose a tiered rate=20
increase.=20
Davis has appointed three members of the PUC, giving his members a majority=
=20
on the five-member board.=20
But this isn't the first time Davis has tried to shy away from PUC decision=
s.=20
In December, when he had appointed just two members, he said, "It doesn't=
=20
matter what I think. The PUC is the legal body that will make a determinati=
on=20
as to what, if any, rate increase is appropriate."=20
Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, elected to his new=20
leadership role just yesterday, said Davis cannot run away from this rate=
=20
increase.=20
"My guess is he has everything to do with it," Cox said. "My guess is Ms.=
=20
Lynch at the PUC doesn't work independently of the governor."=20
But sources in the governor's office insisted that the governor had no=20
knowledge of Lynch's press conference. In fact, they said the governor was=
=20
frustrated by not knowing the announcement was coming.=20
Lawmakers could only shrug yesterday when told that the governor yesterday=
=20
said in written comments that it is his "hope and expectation that this=20
matter can be resolved within the existing rate structure."=20
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the lower house's point man on th=
e=20
energy crisis, called Davis' attempts to keep rates stable "noble."=20
"We are now past the time of pursuing noble goals -- we're at a time when i=
t=20
is important to problem solve," he said. "One of the tools absolutely=20
necessary to solve this problem is to raise rates. I don't like it, I don't=
=20
think there is anybody who does. But to continue now to maintain the fictio=
n=20
that rates don't have to go up, will cause rates to go up more when they do=
=20
go up and will make it take longer to solve the problem."=20
Speier said she believes the problem is "spiraling out of control."=20
"It is a time to take bold steps, such as seizing assets," she said. "This =
is=20
how leadership is tested."=20
Davis has taken pride in being cautious, but in an emergency that lack of=
=20
decisiveness could be his downfall.=20
"As this goes on and the treasury is barren, he is going to be attacked for=
=20
other reasons," DiCamillo said. "As other things get cut from the budget,=
=20
this will loom in the backdrop."=20
One advantage for Davis is that the PUC has often been a scapegoat for=20
unpopular regulatory decisions, DiCamillo said.=20
But on a day when Secretary of State Bill Jones became the first Republican=
=20
to announce that he will oppose Davis in 2002, GOP lawmakers grew bolder in=
=20
their criticism.=20
"Regretably, I don't think the governor even today understands the magnitud=
e=20
of the problem," Cox said. "The governor has to be engaged."=20
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino, said ratepayers will be faced=
=20
with a "Davis price surcharge."=20
"The indecision, the lack of a plan for the last four months has resulted i=
n=20
increased costs that have to be laid at the governor's door," he said.=20

Pleas for Warning Of Next Blackout=20
ISO to address customers' biggest gripe about outages=20

Under intense public pressure, state power regulators will try to solve a=
=20
widespread complaint about the rolling blackouts plaguing California: how t=
o=20
warn people that the lights are about to go out.=20
One of the biggest gripes people have about the outages is getting no advan=
ce=20
warning of outages that render everything plugged into a wall socket utterl=
y=20
useless.=20
While many people say they understand blackouts are, for now, a fact of lif=
e,=20
they also want to know when the next one will roll through their=20
neighborhood.=20
Jillian Hom, an employee at a San Francisco branch of Baskin Robbins, said =
it=20
would sure come in handy to get advance notice of a power outage --=20
especially in the ice cream business.=20
"It would give us time to cover up all the flavors of ice cream so they wou=
ld=20
stay colder longer" she said. "It would also give us time to prepare becaus=
e=20
we're not supposed to stay open during a blackout."=20
Although the utilities pull the plug, the decision to start a rolling=20
blackout is made in Folsom by the Independent System Operator, which manage=
s=20
the state's massive power grid. The outages begin whenever California's=20
electricity reserves dip below 1.5 percent, threatening to bring the grid=
=20
crashing down.=20
ISO board member Carl Guardino thinks it might be time for the agency and t=
he=20
utilities to begin warning people before cutting the juice. He plans to rai=
se=20
the issue during Friday's board meeting.=20
Guardino could not be reached for comment but purportedly wants to balance=
=20
protecting the grid with allowing people to prepare for a blackout.=20
"He understands the situation the ISO is in, and he understands that PG&E i=
s=20
doing the best that it can," said Michelle Montague-Bruno, spokeswoman for=
=20
the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group -- which Guardino leads. "He's=20
completely sympathetic to everything everyone is dealing with. But he also=
=20
thinks we have to do something to improve the system."=20
The inconvenience of a sudden outage goes far beyond missing your favorite=
=20
soap opera or even having the ice cream melt. Businesses lose money.=20
Researchers working with radioactive, infectious or corrosive materials fac=
e=20
grave risks. High-tech firms spend hours or even days recalibrating=20
equipment. The list goes on.=20
These hassles could be minimized, if not avoided, if PG&E would tell people=
=20
when and where the outages will strike, Montague-Bruno said.=20
"The more warning they can give, the more we can prepare," she said.=20
Although the outages often come out of the blue, PG&E's 4.8 million custome=
rs=20
have a vague idea of when it's their turn in the rotation.=20
Customers are assigned to one of 14 blocks, and power is cut to each block=
=20
sequentially. Customers can determine which block they're in by looking at=
=20
the lower left corner of their bill.=20
"If you're in block 14 and we're (cutting power) in block 4, you know you c=
an=20
breathe fairly easily," said utility spokesman Scott Blakey. "But if you're=
=20
in block 5, you know you can expect an outage."=20
But the blocks cover vast swatches of the state, and power can be cut to a=
=20
portion of each block. That leaves critics complaining that block numbers a=
re=20
all but meaningless.=20
Brandie Spencer, a shift manager at the Pasta Pomodoro chain in Berkeley,=
=20
said the restaurant's accounting department deals with the power bills so s=
he=20
has no clue what her block number is.=20
"I have no idea when they plan to pull the plug on us," she said. "But I do=
=20
know that it will be bad if it comes as a surprise in the middle of a busy=
=20
day.=20
We don't have back-up generators, so food orders won't be able to be filled=
,=20
cash registers won't work and I can't very well send customers home."=20
PG&E argues providing more specific information could jeopardize public=20
safety. It claims criminals would know which neighborhoods and businesses=
=20
aren't protected by burglar alarms, security cameras and the like.=20
But authorities in Palo Alto and Alameda -- two cities with municipal=20
utilities that actively tell customers where the next outage will strike an=
d=20
roughly when it's coming -- haven't found any evidence supporting that view=
.=20
"I can't think of a major increase in crime during the blackouts," said Age=
nt=20
Jim Coffman, spokesman for the Palo Alto Police Department.=20
Others note that outages typically come during daylight hours, when crimina=
ls=20
are less likely to strike, or early in the evening, when most folks are hom=
e.=20
PG&E also argues there isn't time to alert millions of people to rolling=20
blackouts, which often start with just a few minutes notice from the ISO.=
=20
"We often do not have any lead time," Blakey said. "The last time we had=20
outages, (the ISO) lost two power plants just like that. Bing, bang, boom a=
nd=20
we were in the middle of a Stage 3 alert."=20
Municipal utilities also have a fraction of the customers that PG&E does,=
=20
which makes it far easier for them to notify people, Blakey said.=20
"We have an average of 225,000 people in each block," he said.=20
That's about 10 times as many people as the Palo Alto Utility Department=20
serves. But municipal utilities said notifying customers isn't particularly=
=20
difficult -- or costly -- thanks to the Internet.=20
Alameda Power and Telecom spent about $20,000 creating a system using a=20
telephone hot line, e-mails and faxes to provide information to its 32,000=
=20
customers, said utility spokesman Matt McCabe. The information is available=
=20
within minutes of an ISO call for outages, he said.=20
"It wasn't a tremendous expenditure of money, but it has been a lot of time=
,=20
" McCabe said. "But Alamedans have a very high expectation, and rightfully=
=20
so, that we should keep them apprised of the power situation. That's an=20
obligation that we have."=20

PUC set to give up on rate freeze; increases up to 36% likely=20

BY VBY JOHN WOOLFOLK=20

vMercury News=20


State regulators today are poised to deliver consumers a jolt by boosting=
=20
residential electric bills as much as 36 percent or $47 a month.=20
The California Public Utilities Commission's proposed rate increase comes o=
n=20
top of a 9 percent ``temporary'' increase approved in January and despite=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis' promises to solve the state's crisis without higher rates.=
=20
Regulators plan to make that 9 percent increase permanent as well. The high=
er=20
rates would take effect immediately upon expected approval at today's meeti=
ng=20
and would appear on bills beginning in May.=20
``We have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is=20
needed,'' said Loretta Lynch, the commission's president. ``It's time to pa=
y=20
the power bills for California.''=20
Under the tiered-rate proposal, more than half of residential customers wou=
ld=20
see their bills jump by $6 to $47 a month. But energy misers and the poor=
=20
won't see any increase.=20
Industrial customers, who historically enjoyed lower rates than homeowners,=
=20
would see their bills soar more than 40 percent. Commercial customers would=
=20
pay 22 percent more than they do now.=20
Lynch described the plan as a way to encourage conservation and help avoid=
=20
blackouts this summer.=20
``Electricity hogs will need to pay more for the energy they use this=20
summer,'' she said.=20
Davis, who appointed a majority of the utilities commissioners, including=
=20
Lynch, was said to be fuming over Monday's announcement.=20
``It is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved=20
within the existing rate structure,'' Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.=
=20
Consumer advocates blasted the increase as a betrayal.=20
``It's obviously a huge disappointment for consumers,'' said Robert=20
Finkelstein, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network.=20
``Up to this time, the Davis administration and the PUC, in particular, had=
=20
made encouraging noises about getting the money out of the generators,''=20
Finkelstein said, referring to private companies charging high wholesale=20
rates for power. ``This draft decision seems to be an abandonment of that=
=20
position in favor of taking it out of the consumers' hides.''=20
But most state lawmakers have abandoned hope of avoiding higher consumer=20
rates. In recent weeks, they've seen negotiations to prop up the foundering=
=20
utilities stall and the administration's efforts to secure low-cost power=
=20
contracts fall far short of expectations.=20
Meanwhile, the state has been spending more than $1 billion a month buying=
=20
power for the major utilities, mostly on short-term markets, where prices=
=20
have risen eightfold.=20
``I don't think anybody is fooled about the inevitability of a rate=20
increase,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco.=20
Assembly Speaker pro tem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, a central figure in the=
=20
state's efforts to resolve the crisis, called Davis' rate-increase resistan=
ce=20
a noble but unrealistic goal.=20
``We are now past the time of pursuing noble goals,'' Keeley said. ``We are=
=20
at a time where it is important to problem-solve.''=20
Commissioners, who hastily drafted the rate increase over the weekend, said=
=20
it was needed to keep the major utilities from sinking into bankruptcy, whi=
ch=20
they fear could unravel the state's electric system. Pacific Gas & Electric=
=20
Co. and Southern California Edison have been nearly bankrupted by soaring=
=20
wholesale power costs that aren't covered by their state-frozen rates.=20
Officials at PG&E and Southern California Edison were combing through the=
=20
PUC's rate-increase proposal Monday. PG&E declined to comment.=20
Commissioners blamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for failing t=
o=20
rein in wholesale power costs with price caps despite mounting evidence tha=
t=20
independent energy companies are gouging California consumers.=20
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said a rate rise could ease approval =
of=20
legislation she is carrying that would force federal regulators to enact a=
=20
regional price cap.=20
``There has been some resistance by members of Congress who feel the people=
=20
of California have not fully faced up to the energy crisis,'' said Feinstei=
n=20
spokesman Howard Gantman.=20
The proposed rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, along with the=20
1-cent increase in January, would push California residential rates over 15=
=20
cents, among the highest in the nation.=20
Rates will be based on how much electricity customers use. Power-pinching=
=20
residential consumers who use no more than 130 percent of their ``baseline'=
'=20
allotment, an amount based on regional climate, would see no further rate=
=20
increase at all. Poor customers who qualify for rate assistance also would =
be=20
exempted.=20
But PG&E residential customers who exceed 130 percent of the baseline --=20
currently more than half -- would see their bills rise 9 to 36 percent.=20
State regulators said they needed to quickly boost the utilities' revenues=
=20
with higher rates to keep small energy producers from cutting off supplies.=
=20
Another concern was that the utilities haven't paid the California Departme=
nt=20
of Water Resources for the power it has been buying since January for their=
=20
customers, draining billions from the state's general fund.=20
In approving the rate increase, regulators plan to order the utilities to p=
ay=20
the small generators and the state for their ongoing power costs, and to=20
reimburse the state for its past purchases.=20
PG&E and Edison have received some $400 million in additional revenue from=
=20
the earlier rate increase and now have more than $4 billion in the bank,=20
regulators said.=20
Even so, regulators say utilities still face a cash-flow problem. The new=
=20
increase will add $4.8 billion to their annual revenues.=20
The commission, however, is ordering the utilities only to pay power=20
companies for ongoing costs. It does not address the $1.5 billion owed to t=
he=20
small generators or the billions in debt to large power suppliers.=20
Lynch said no further rate increase should be necessary, and that consumers=
=20
could be refunded if investigations show they've been overcharged.=20

Gov. Davis' hard line against higher rates is fuel for challengers=20

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau=20


SACRAMENTO -- The political sharks are starting to circle Gov. Gray Davis a=
s=20
the state's energy crisis threatens to drain the average Californian's=20
wallet.=20
With energy regulators -- most of them Davis appointees -- preparing today =
to=20
raise rates, opponents on his left and right are beginning to smell blood,=
=20
raising their hopes of making Davis the first one-term California governor =
in=20
more than 50 years.=20
Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones, sounding what is expected to be a=
=20
key theme, announced his long-expected plan Monday to challenge the=20
Democratic governor next year by accusing Davis of putting ``his head in th=
e=20
sand'' during the energy crisis.=20
Consumer groups are vowing a ``ratepayer revolt'' and ballot measure that=
=20
could batter Davis during his re-election campaign.=20
And Davis is facing the growing possibility that a member of his own party=
=20
may view the governor as vulnerable enough to challenge him for the=20
Democratic nomination.=20
``The political danger is in rates,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the=
=20
non-partisan Field Institute. ``That's when the political punch hits.=20
``If the rates rise and the governor hasn't been able to hold them back, hi=
s=20
standing would start to crumble.''=20
For weeks, Davis has been expressing his ``hope and expectation'' that ener=
gy=20
bills wouldn't need to rise more than the 20 percent that's already been=20
approved. He has sought to portray himself as a staunch defender of the=20
average Californian.=20
Once again, Monday, even as his own political appointees to the Public=20
Utilities Commission were proposing immediate and stunning rate hikes, Davi=
s=20
again expressed his ``hope and expectation'' that such a move would not be=
=20
necessary.=20
But as the crisis appears to worsen, there seem to be few people left,=20
including those on governor's own staff, who believe the problems can be=20
solved without asking Californians to pay more -- dramatically more -- for=
=20
power.=20
In some ways, Davis has painted himself into a corner much the way Presiden=
t=20
Bush hurt his 1992 re-election chances by breaking his ``no new taxes''=20
pledge.=20
Two options for Davis=20
Davis faces two options: oppose rate increases that nearly everyone else se=
es=20
as inevitable and take continuing hits for failing to lead, or reverse cour=
se=20
and face criticism for abandoning his longstanding opposition.=20
Either choice could hurt his political prospects -- both for governor and a=
s=20
a potential presidential candidate in 2004.=20
In the Capitol, some lawmakers, Democrats included, are becoming increasing=
ly=20
frustrated at his refusal to talk about raising rates and have begun to rai=
se=20
questions about his leadership.=20
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, called the governor's stand against=
=20
rate increases ``a noble goal,'' but added, ``We are now past the time of=
=20
pursuing noble goals.''=20
``One of the tools that will be absolutely necessary to solve this problem =
is=20
to raise rates,'' said Keeley, one of the Legislature's key energy=20
negotiators. ``To continue now to maintain the fiction that rates don't hav=
e=20
to go up will cause rates to go up more when they go up and will take longe=
r=20
to solve the problem.''=20
Another senior Democratic lawmaker likened the governor's position to=20
President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War when the violent morass=
=20
engulfed his administration, created a national crisis and pressured him to=
=20
abandon his 1968 re-election bid.=20
``There will inevitably be people surfacing who will challenge the governor=
=20
from within the party,'' the lawmaker said.=20
Jones to challenge Davis=20
On Monday, Secretary of State Jones -- the only Republican in statewide=20
office -- said he would challenge Davis next year and used the energy crisi=
s=20
as his major hammer.=20
Jones told reporters in Sacramento that Davis turned a blind eye to=20
skyrocketing energy costs in San Diego last summer, an early warning that=
=20
could have helped the state avert the electrical mess.=20
``Instead, the governor chose not to have a bold, aggressive plan,'' Jones=
=20
said. ``He chose to basically put his head in the sand, and hope that the=
=20
problem would go away.''=20
But Davis still holds some commanding advantages. He has raised an=20
intimidating $26 million for his re-election campaign -- compared with=20
$118,000 for Jones. And he continues to receive strong support from=20
Californians in polls.=20
``I think that one of the reasons that the governor's public standing has=
=20
remained favorable is because the average person out there clearly=20
understands that he has been fighting the good fight on behalf of=20
ratepayers,'' said Garry South, the governor's chief political consultant.=
=20
Even so, more and more lawmakers are urging Davis to take more decisive ste=
ps=20
to bring the crisis under control, which could undermine the image of Davis=
=20
as a methodical, but sure-footed chief executive.=20
``I think the governor should peek out from behind the curtain'' and tell=

Californians what he intends to do to solve the crisis, said Assemblywoman=

Seeing the light in energy crisis=20
Tuesday, March 27, 2001=20
Reality finally seems to be breaking through a little on the electricity=20
crisis: "California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike in=20
electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage customer=
s=20
to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the hot summe=
r=20
months," AP reported yesterday.=20
"Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates=20
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rat=
e=20
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour."
The PUC could vote as early as today to increase rates, with the effective=
=20
date as early as April 1. A rate hike of less than 40 percent also is=20
possible. Although Gov. Gray Davis continues publicly to oppose rate hikes,=
=20
Ms. Lynch is a close political associate of his and was appointed by him.=
=20
"It's a move in the right direction," Robert Michaels, a professor of=20
economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. But he said he didn't know how=
=20
much prices should go up because of uncertainty in other areas. "Even in=20
Sacramento everybody is saying rates could double in a year. Nobody knows=
=20
what's being spent by the state on short-term energy. Or long-term energy. =
Or=20
knows all the unknowns of the long-term contracts" the state signed earlier=
=20
this month.=20
A 40 percent rate increase also wouldn't cover "all the things from the pas=
t=20
- the bills the utilities have to pay" to the independent electricity=20
generators. But there is one positive aspect, he said: "It will convince=20
consumers that there really is a scarcity in electricity."=20
Unfortunately, a rate increase could come in a politically manipulated form=
.=20
"Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers'=
=20
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use mo=
re=20
power pay more than those who conserve," reported the San Francisco=20
Chronicle. "Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his o=
wn=20
staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system."
"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," Ms. Lynch told=
=20
the Chronicle. "People who use a whole lot of power should pay more."
"It's an idea we can use rates to redistribute wealth," Mr. Michaels said. =
He=20
also pointed out that the crisis really doesn't involve large, industrial=
=20
users, who use a mostly constant amount of electricity in their business an=
d=20
manufacturing processes year-round. Rather, the problem mainly is with=20
residences, which comprise one-third of usage but which are the "main users=
=20
of the peak time, the evening, when air conditioning is turned on."
Can't the state politicians look beyond the current crisis, for once? As th=
e=20
state heads into a recession, do we really want to charge more to large=20
electricity users, such as businesses? And what if the many new Internet=20
"server" businesses can't cut power, just to name one industry? Businesses=
=20
would begin avoiding this state like a cow avoids an electric fence.
And what about people who stay home because they're retired, sick or for so=
me=20
other reason? Should they pay more if they can't cut back? We don't charge=
=20
more for gasoline for people who drive 50 miles to work than for people who=
=20
drive 10 miles. Why should electricity be different?
Even as the state moves toward more rational pricing of electricity, the=20
mistake would be compounded by a rate structure that might be difficult to=
=20
dismantle as more power plants come on line and the crisis passes.
Finally, this crisis began with a flawed approach to free markets, misnamed=
=20
deregulation, and last fall deepened quickly as Gov. Davis and the=20
Legislature responded with every possible government solution that might=20
avoid the inevitable - higher electric rates. Now, the state faces the wors=
t=20
of all possible worlds: a future with high electrcity prices, inadequate=20
power production particularly for summer, a massive debt for power bills ow=
ed=20
and a potential large deficit blown through what was once a state budget wi=
th=20
a surplus.

California's top electricity regulator Monday proposed a rate increase of a=

The plan by Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities=20

more consumers use, the more they would pay, Lynch said.=20
"Electricity hogs will need to pay more for the energy they use this=20

increase, Lynch said, because their usage is 130 percent or less of=20
"baseline," a subsistence level that varies regionally in the state.=20
Consumers who use between 130 percent and 200 percent of baseline would fac=
e=20
increases of as much as 9 percent, while those who use more than 200 percen=
t=20
of baseline would pay the biggest increases.=20
Since January, the state has put itself in the precarious position of buyin=
g=20
power for the utilities at a rate of $45 million to $66 million a day - wit=
h=20
no mechanism to recoup the funds.=20
The rate increase would pay for the state's current and future power=20
purchases - which are estimated at $23 billion through 2002. It also would=

cover power purchases from independent producers, known as qualifying=20
facilities, whose unwillingness to operate without being paid contributed t=

Mark-

Today, we received IBJ's responsive comments to the points that have been=
=20
raised, which are set forth below for your review.

IBJ has stated "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral=
=20
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  During our recent=20
meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial=20
institutions.  I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan=
=20
from IBJ of roughly US$ 100,000,000.
Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his=20
input. =20

IBJ's specific responses are quoted below as follows:-

"Part 1

(a)  Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA.

(g)  We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as=
=20
for a party, a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor=
e.

Part 3

We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only.

Part 4

(f)Even though deleting the word "not" in this provision, we can net the=20
payments with respect to the same Transaction.   Due to our system=20
incapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo=
re=20
Transactions in the same currency.

(h) Agreed.

Part 5

(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to=
=20
continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation,=
=20
which does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=
=20
Event of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20
releases a technical error.

(c)  Agreed.

(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.

(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20
branch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend=
=20
this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We hea=
rd=20
that in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off th=
e=20
obligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.

(i)  Agreed to include this provision.

(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation=
s=20
without the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get=
=20
approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might=
=20
cause an additional payment of tax or other cost.

(k)  We will revert to you later.

(m)  Agreed.

(n)  Agreed to include this provision.

Part 6

We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity=20
Transactions in the respective Confirmations."

I look forward to receiving your input.  I note that Jane McBride has start=

=09=09 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

 I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it=
=20
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow=
=20
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =
we=20
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=
=20
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=
=20
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=
=20
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=
=20
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=
=20
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=
=20
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=
=20
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=
e=20
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=
s=20
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=
e=20
volume and nature of their comments.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of "EDGAR" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

Best regards,

Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a "Credit Matrix" which prescribes=
 a=20
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral=20
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each=20
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and=
=20
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC)=20
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot=20
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  W=
e=20
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates,=
=20
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose =
to=20
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is=
=20
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract withou=
t=20
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of =
a=20
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC=
=20
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively=
=20
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty wit=
h=20
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of=
=20
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the=20
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utiliz=
e=20
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our=
=20
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in=
=20
our recent conference call. =20

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financia=
l=20
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the=20
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective=20
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this=
=20
issue was "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral=20
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  The legitimacy of this=
=20
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be=
=20
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do=

Mark-

Today, we received IBJ's responsive comments to the points that have been=
=20
raised, which are set forth below for your review.

IBJ has stated "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral=
=20
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  During our recent=20
meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial=20
institutions.  I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan=
=20
from IBJ of roughly US$ 100,000,000.
Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his=20
input. =20

IBJ's specific responses are quoted below as follows:-

"Part 1

(a)  Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA.

(g)  We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as=
=20
for a party, a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor=
e.

Part 3

We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only.

Part 4

(f)Even though deleting the word "not" in this provision, we can net the=20
payments with respect to the same Transaction.   Due to our system=20
incapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo=
re=20
Transactions in the same currency.

(h) Agreed.

Part 5

(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to=
=20
continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation,=
=20
which does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=
=20
Event of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20
releases a technical error.

(c)  Agreed.

(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.

(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20
branch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend=
=20
this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We hea=
rd=20
that in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off th=
e=20
obligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.

(i)  Agreed to include this provision.

(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation=
s=20
without the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get=
=20
approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might=
=20
cause an additional payment of tax or other cost.

(k)  We will revert to you later.

(m)  Agreed.

(n)  Agreed to include this provision.

Part 6

We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity=20
Transactions in the respective Confirmations."

I look forward to receiving your input.  I note that Jane McBride has start=
ed=20

not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=

any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of "EDGAR" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before

Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play 
given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the 
customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility?  
Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated 
structure in the RFP?

Is this a play that you would support? 

On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso 
note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to 
quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.

How is it going otherwise?

Subject: Re: Devil's Tower  

David,

Devils Tower is a deepwater project on Mississippi Canyon block 773.  
Dominion is the operator and has a 60% working interest in the project.  
Mariner Energy (20%) and Pioneer Resources (20%) are the remaining working 
interest owners.

During the first week of September, Production Offshore, managed by Tom 
Byargeon, received an RFP and an information packet to submit a proposal for 
the development of a floating production system and export pipelines.

Since the Devils Towers project exists in a prolific active deepwater reserve 
area and this area has little developed infrastructure, this project is 
strategic and creates a very relevant and marketable infrastructure 
position.  For example, Exxon has indicated their interest in tying back 
their production from Crazy Horse (south of Devils Tower) to this platform.  
In addition, the production from this platform could be funneled into Exxon's 
export pipelines on the shelf.

This project will financed by a structure where Enron forms a joint venture 
(JV) with an independent third party.   The joint venture partners capitalize 
the JV with a nominal amount of funds.  The JV leases capacity on the 
platform and export pipelines from a special purpose vehicle (SPV).  The SPV 
uses the lease agreement to obtain a loan from financial institutions.  In 
turn, the SPV uses equity capital (from a tax based investor) and the loan 
proceeds to purchase or develop the deepwater assets.

The JV receives cash flows from leasing the production capacity from the 
Devils Tower deepwater assets.  This capacity on the deepwater assets will be 
sold for five to seven years under a production handling agreement (PHA).  
Final point, the JV receives a financial instrument (most likely a note 
receivable)  equal to their portion of the net proceeds from the PHA.

Enron books income on the monetization of this financial instrument via a 
FASB sell down (most likely, selling a note receivable to a bank for cash).  
In addition, because the lease capacity for the deepwater assets will be sold 
for only five-seven years and these assets will have a minimum working life 
for twenty, there exists potential upside for Enron.  For example, cash flows 
from incremental PHAs (ie., through tiebacks to Devils Tower deepwater 
assets) can be monetized via the FASB 125 sell down.

The financial structure was designed to minimize capital outlays and 
financial risk.  Also, Joe Deffner and Roger Ondreko are very familar with 
the structure and assisted in its design.

The RFP is due October 2nd.   There will a meeting tommorrow from 1-3 pm to 
discuss the status of the proposal in EB 3583. Please feel free to attend.

Regards, 

Jean

Today, we received IBJ's responsive comments to the points that have been=
=20
raised, which are set forth below for your review.

IBJ has stated "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral=
=20
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  During our recent=20
meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial=20
institutions.  I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan=
=20
from IBJ of roughly US$ 100,000,000.
Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his=20
input. =20

IBJ's specific responses are quoted below as follows:-

"Part 1

(a)  Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA.

(g)  We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as=

e.

Part 3

We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only.

Part 4

(f)Even though deleting the word "not" in this provision, we can net the=20
payments with respect to the same Transaction.   Due to our system=20
incapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo=
re=20
Transactions in the same currency.

(h) Agreed.

Part 5

(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to=
=20
continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation,=
=20
which does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=

Event of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20
releases a technical error.

(c)  Agreed.

(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.

(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20
branch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend=
=20
this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We hea=
rd=20
that in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off th=
e=20
obligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.

(i)  Agreed to include this provision.

(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation=
s=20
without the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get=
=20
approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might=
=20
cause an additional payment of tax or other cost.

(k)  We will revert to you later.

(m)  Agreed.

(n)  Agreed to include this provision.

Part 6

We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity=20
Transactions in the respective Confirmations."

I look forward to receiving your input.  I note that Jane McBride has start=

this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=
=20
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=
=20
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=
=20
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=
e=20
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=
s=20
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=

volume and nature of their comments.

FULL EMAIL BODY:
Edie,
I have left the following (in part) on Roger Ondreko's voice mail last week.  
Here is the wrap-up for the remainder of Q'4.

Chicago-/Origination/Hub/Trading - $1.7MM (down from $2.8MM)
 Two transactions have been terminated as follows:  1) QNT Management with 
PGL/NS - Proceeds mark to market were to be $480,000 to Enron.  Due to recent 
filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission on affiliate transactions, it 
was deemed that this transaction may bring too much scrutiny to enovate.  For 
2000, approximately 80% of business to PGL/NS are being transacted with 
either ENA, EMW or enovate.  Net loss $480,000 mark-to-market with potential 
accrual value in the $100,000 to $500,000 range.  2)  LS Power Plant - At 
execution stage for fuel balancing for combined cycle power facility with 
both Williams and LS who were both deemed as counterparties on transaction.  
Williams' board of directors did not approve the purchase of facility and LS 
has now sold to NRG (November 7, 2000).  Transaction now becomes a 2001 deal 
with high probability of closure.  Net loss of 4th quarter mark-to-market 
$1.5MM and accrual upside.  3)  Off-Balance Sheet Financing/Gas Supply 
Receivable - Due to cash short fall for PEC, ENA was to extend $50MM of 
receivables for 2 months under the ENA/PGL gas supply agreement through an 
Enron Global Finance off-balance sheet vehicle.  ENA was to receive 200 basis 
points of origination, netting $165,000 to Chicago, with no negative cash 
flow or balance sheet implications to Enron.

Storage Monetization - Move to 1st Quarter 2001
 Peoples Energy received short term financing to get them through their end 
of year cash flow issues, which pushes the transaction to 2001.  On the 
positive, the Peoples Board of Directors approved capital spending for oil 
and gas properties of $60MM for 1st quarter 2001 and our structure on the 
monetization provides them competitive off-balance sheet financing.  Higher 
gas prices in years 2 and 3 due to greatly diminishing backwardation in 
Chicago basis and  Nymex have increased the value of the transaction 
approximately $12MM in the past two weeks.   Value to Enron in 2001 $5MM to 
$25MM.

The numbers must be looked at in entirety for Chicago and not broken down 
Origination/Trading on the receipt to Houston.  The $1.7MM is the gross Enron 
number for Chicago for 4th quarter, 2000.  In the $1.7MM, there will be 
mid-market transactions and trading, with the trading number daily reflecting 
the risk associated with a trading P&L.

In respect to the overall Chicago numbers, please ensure you are picking up 
enovate books and Chicago origination which are granted via 1) central desk 
2) EMW and 3) East Origination.

Please contact me if you have further questions or need further clarification.

Laura,
Just wanted to touch base on your Hot List Items for East Origination for 4Q 
2000.
We currently still have listed the following:

Chicago - Hub Gas Management - 4 Deals $2,800,000
Manlove Storage Monetization  $10,000,000

To date, we have booked the following origination amounts:
October $141,555
November $ 90,786

Total  $232,341

Could you give me an update on the status of the $2.8 million gas management 
items as well as the Storage Monetization?
(i.e. Do we still plan to make the $2.8 Million and is the $10.0 million 
Storage Monetization still feasible for 4Q?)

Your input will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Edie

Through May 31, the state paid a trading arm of Sempra Energy, the parent o=

To Matt Muniz, the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the Santa Rita=

When all 4,000 panels are completely installed this month, the 500-kilowatt=

percent, according to Muniz, Alameda County's energy program manager.=20

"With the cost of electricity going up, you can start looking at it as a=20

WASHINGTON =01) With talks between the state and power generators stalled,=

California may go to court to help win the $8.9 billion state officials=20

"The numbers were too far apart," said Curtis Wagner, the FERC chief=20

Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may ask for $20=20

Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges from the Pacific=20

Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will=20

Consumer advocates assailed the judge's recommendation and urged the state =

"It's like catching a bank robber, but instead of making him give back all =

Power generators, however, were generally pleased with Wagner's comments.=

Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, said even if the formula=20

California officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public=20

"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe=

billion dollars," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief administrative law judge for=
=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previewing the=20
recommendations he will make to the commission.=20
But Wagner, who mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are=
=20
still owed sums for electricity "that probably are higher than any=20
overcharges" for which they may have to pay refunds.=20
That opened the possibility that California could see no cash refunds, only=
 a=20

Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a "fast-track hearing" to try=

to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising from=20
California's power crisis.=20
Wagner also outlined a method that he said FERC should use for calculating=
=20
refunds.=20
While his proposed formula includes part of one method the state used, it=
=20
contains several elements for calculating electricity costs that were favor=
ed=20
by power sellers, who maintain that California's numbers are wildly=20

"I would suspect that would result in a number much below $8.9 billion," sa=

Joe Ronan, vice president of Calpine, a San Jose-based electricity generato=
r.=20
"I think (Wagner's method) reflects more accurately what actually happened"=
=20
in the state's dysfunctional power market.=20
But Michael Kahn, the state's lead negotiator, said Wagner "vindicated"=20
California's core arguments.=20
"The hundreds of people who came here on the other side had argued to the=
=20
mediator that there should not be any refunds, and that position was loudly=
=20
rejected," said Kahn, chairman of the organization that manages most of=20
California's power grid.=20
"We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be in t=
he=20
multiple billions. Whatever amount of money .?.?. is awarded to us, we will=
=20
have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder=
.=20
So what we have here is a situation where California will get its $8.9=20
billion."=20
Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome =
to=20
them. They sought an end to investigations of their conduct, and immunity=
=20
from legal action as part of their bargaining position.=20
During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowher=
e=20
near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers had=
=20
put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.=20
"That's a long way from splitting the difference," he said. "In 15 days, yo=
u=20
can't work miracles."=20
Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will between=
=20
the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the=20
previously closed hearings.=20
Each side essentially accused the other of bargaining in bad faith and=20
failing to put forward realistic proposals.=20
John H. Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group,=
=20
said the state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion=20
refund demand. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off t=
he=20
$300 million it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.=20
Kahn shot back that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and nev=

approached the state.=20
Figures scrutinized
"This is the first time we've heard any of this information. And to give th=
e=20
impression that somehow there's been cooperation or forthcomingness, I thin=
k=20
is misleading," Kahn said.=20
The state's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talk=
s.=20
The $8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid=
=20
operator of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period=
=20
when wholesale power prices soared.=20
Kahn said the figure was essentially duplicated when the state went back an=
d=20
calculated what power costs would have been if a pricing method instituted =
by=20
FERC last month had been in effect for the entire yearlong period.=20
FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to tame wholesale prices in the=20
West.=20
In a partial win for the state, Wagner said he would recommend that FERC us=
e=20
the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds, an approach=20
resisted by the power sellers.=20
But he said that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October=
=20
2000, and should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are=
=20
calculated.=20
For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas heat =
it=20
takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market prices in=
=20
Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rather than =
a=20
statewide average cost, computed monthly.=20
Fewer overcharges?
Those and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could=20
increase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of=
=20
overcharges.=20
Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to October would pu=
t=20
about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North=20
America, said, "We think (Wagner's) modifications are certainly a vast=20
improvement over FERC's June 19 order and also certainly over (the state's)=
=20
model."=20
America.=20
In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement characterizing the=20
electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith.=20
"While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers=

they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9=20

SACRAMENTO -- On three days in May, California's daily power spending toppe=
d=20
$100 million, according to a report released yesterday by state power=20
traders.=20
The California Department of Water Resources report, which addressed spot=
=20
market electricity purchases since January, was released along with 1,770=
=20
pages of documents that specifically detailed the first three months of=20
last-minute power purchases.=20
Such power buys on the spot market typically get the most expensive=20
electricity available.=20
The report details the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, whe=
n=20
the state took over electricity purchases for Pacific Gas and Electric Co.,=
=20
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., and Southern California Edison.=20
The utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy=
=20
enough to purchase power. Since then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion=
=20
to keep the lights on.=20
The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The=20
second-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.=
=20
The day before, the state spent $100 million.=20
But since May, spot market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate=20
weather, lower natural gas prices, increased conservation which lowered=20
demand and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators int=
o=20
possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray Davis has said long-term contracts=
=20
also drove the price down.=20
"It does look like some of the spot market prices have gone down, but it=20
looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis,=20
spokesman for Assembly Republicans.=20
The slight reduction in spot market prices "underscores questions about the=
=20
strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, if natural gas prices=20
continue to drop," Fisfis said.=20
Most of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20=
=20
years.=20
"It's unfortunate that it looks like we'll never get out from under these=
=20
contracts," Fisfis said.=20
Davis has already released details of the state's long-term power contracts=
=20
after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several news=20
organizations, including The Associated Press and The Copley Press, which=
=20
publishes The San Diego Union-Tribune.=20
Davis released copies of those contracts, but wanted to delay the release o=
f=20
the spot market buys and short-term contracts. Releasing those details too=
=20
soon after the purchases would reveal the state's buying strategy and could=
=20
cause generators to raise their already sky-high prices, Davis said.=20
The number of spot market buys will lessen, the Davis administration says, =
as=20
more long-term contracts are signed, reducing the state's exposure to the=
=20
high-priced purchases.=20
The governor's office will release future short-term contracts and spot=20
market buys will be released on a quarterly basis, with a 90-day lag time.=
=20
Second quarter information will be released in October and third quarter=20
documents will be available in January.=20
Davis maintains the delay is needed to protect its ability to negotiate=20
further spot-market power buys.=20
According to the water department, Canadian Powerex, the marketing arm of B=
C=20
Hydro, has been paid $1.05 billion for spot market purchases as of May 31.=
=20
But Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. topped that list, getting $1.24 billion as o=
f=20
the end of May.=20
The newly released short-term contracts also show what the state had to pay=
=20
when it needed power the most.=20
On March 19 and 20, when rolling blackouts hit California again, the state=
=20
was forced into paying above-average prices in its largest short-term=20
contracts.=20
For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatts an hour at off-peak usage=
=20
times on March 20 for $345 a megawatt hour, more than $70 above the average=
=20
price of $272.96.=20

FERC Judge Says State Owed No More Than $1 Billion
From Associated Press

July 9 2001

WASHINGTON -- California is owed no more than "a billion dollars" from powe=
r=20
wholesalers, a federal regulatory judge said today at the end of 15 days of=
=20
settlement talks in the state's electricity crisis.

Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief=20
administrative law judge, said that at the same time the power suppliers=20
probably are owed more than that.

The net effect of his preliminary recommendation is that California probabl=
y=20
will receive no refunds from wholesalers.

Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in refunds. The state=
=20
has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said he will not recommen=
d=20
refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.

It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary=20
recommendation would have on efforts to settle the dispute.

Both sides said before the judge's announcement that they expected a=20
protracted legal battle in the event the talks did not produce a settlement=
.

Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Davis's representative in the talks, has said the=
=20
state would seek more than twice the claimed overcharges if the dispute mov=
ed=20
from mediated talks to a courtroom.

The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are grossly=20
inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dynegy,=20
Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that the=
y=20
have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."

John H. Stout, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company=
=20
would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall=
=20
settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal=
=20
claims.

But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains=
=20
that no refunds are justified."

FERC ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences betwe=
en=20
producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated=20
electricity market.

The state has accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly driv=
e=20
up prices. The producers have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame=
=20
jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the=
=20
workings of the free market.

The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year=
=20
from $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated that the state could=
=20
spend as much as $50 billion this year.

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame
Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried,=

TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 10 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse grou=
p=20
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who h=
as=20
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show.

During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of=
=20
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private=20
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid t=
o=20
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the=
=20
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.

Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per=
=20
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas=
 &=20
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe=

the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour=20
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292=
=20
an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies=20
singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc.,=
=20
Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid=
=20
for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe=
r=20
megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.

The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased=
=20
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more=
=20
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencie=
s.

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest=
=20
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have=20
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.

"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.

"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the=20
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%=
=20
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are chargi=
ng=20
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting=20
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."

The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times o=
n=20
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's=20
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first=20
quarter.

The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in th=
e=20
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's=
=20
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited=
=20
to a few generators.

Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the=20
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year=
.=20
"All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs sin=
ce=20
his agency began buying power in mid-January.

The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 =
in=20
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour t=
o=20
$271, the reports show.

In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded=
=20
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, o=
ne=20
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per=20
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, =
a=20
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.

By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a=20
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average=20
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.

A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of=
=20
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not b=
e=20
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past,=
=20
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered=20
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.

A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,=
=20
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to se=
e=20
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reach=
ed=20
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing=

the power needed by the state were extremely high.

More Power Bought Than Projected

Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,=
=20
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas=
=20
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.

Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,=20
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.

Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply proble=

in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of stat=

projections in June and early July.

The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June=

Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data
Power: Senator says the generator is refusing to make public some informati=
on=20
crucial to the price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 10 2001

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price=20
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy=
=20
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigatio=
n.

Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding informatio=
n=20
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But=
=20
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public withou=
t=20
Duke's consent.

The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have=20
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days i=
n=20
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the=20
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing througho=
ut=20
the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation a=
nd=20
efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential=20
information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.

Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tha=
t=20
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and=
=20
which stay secret.

"The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by wh=
at=20
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.

Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers

Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the informati=
on=20
elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."

Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last mont=
h=20
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh=
at=20
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.

But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=20
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity=
=20
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its=20
explanation.

Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full=
=20
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.

But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,=
=20
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed dat=
a,=20
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.

"Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full=20
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions=
=20
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.

To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive=
=20
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke=20
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the=
=20
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.

Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in=20
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and=20
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to=20
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke=
=20
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records t=
he=20
committee plans to turn over.

"We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we ar=
e=20
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't=
=20
know what we are ultimately going to do."

The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they=
=20
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, ha=
ve=20
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,=
=20
were cited.

Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are=20
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formal=
ly=20
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is th=
e=20
final arbiter of such issues.

Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited=
=20
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most=

NEWS ANALYSIS
Concern Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows
Embedded costs may yield more rate hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion=

TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 9 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Even as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gra=
y=20
Davis prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch=
=20
on a new power plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly=
=20
more daunting task of balancing the books.

It's a task with potentially far more long-lasting implications for state=
=20
coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for consumers' wallets.

In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by the governor's office=
=20
as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-control electricity=20
market are having the opposite effect politically. A growing concern about=
=20
the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of Davis' mo=
st=20
ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial rescue of Southern=20
California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate in the Legislature=
.=20
Questions about the contracts come as California readies a complex=20
$13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund for other pow=
er=20
purchases.

Critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts, on top of the billions=
=20
needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead to additional electricity=
=20
rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer advocates and business=20
lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated.

Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these critics say the sta=
te=20
should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the=
=20
prices. They argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after=
=20
California's utilities neared insolvency and the state Department of Water=
=20
Resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than 25 million=
=20
residents.

"They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen=20
(D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state struck with independent power=20
companies when prices were at record highs.

Bowen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals th=
ey=20
could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiation=
s=20
took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."

Contracts Open to Challenges

The contracts could be challenged in court or, more immediately, before the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. There, an administrativ=
e=20
law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement o=
f=20
allegations by Davis that generators overcharged the state for electricity =
by=20
$8.9 billion.

"We ought not to say, 'Fine, the contracts were the best we could do,' "=20
Bowen said.

For his part, Davis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.=
9=20
billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He=
=20
attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to=20
conservation, the administration's effort to increase power supply and--a=
=20
major factor--the long-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance o=
n=20
the volatile daily, or spot, market.

"You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . . dramatically=20
shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Californians," Davis=
=20
said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30% from May to=
=20
June.

Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped negotiate the contracts,=
=20
said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, given the recent declin=
e=20
in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for California's=20
electricity-generating plants.

Freeman also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to=
=20
douse a blaze. "After the fire is out," he said, "you complain about the=20
water damage."

The contracts have other defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics=20
professor Severin Borenstein, who says the deals helped to tame the volatil=
e=20
spot market by reducing generators' incentive to drive up prices, while=20
reducing the state's exposure to wild swings in price.

"The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great price; it's=
=20
to reduce risk," Borenstein said.

Still, experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior=20
Court judge in San Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit=
=20
by news organizations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Dav=
is=20
unseal the contracts.

An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each representing=
=20
Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group; a=
nd=20
large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-billion price tag=
=20
announced by the administration may not account for all the costs. When oth=
er=20
expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to=
=20
any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an additional 10% to=
=20
20%.

"Once the contracts were made public," Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte =
of=20
Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who can read began calling for=20
those contracts to be renegotiated."

As buyers' remorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly=
=20
are seen as a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront=
=20
fast-approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis fro=
m=20
morphing into a broader financial crisis.

A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled=20
Southern California Edison must be approved by Aug. 15. The deadline could =
be=20
tighter, because the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong=20
break July 20.

Davis' rescue plan, along with legislative alternatives, languishes in the=
=20
Legislature. The plan, which has little apparent support, would require the=
=20
state to buy Edison's system of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and=20
permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3=
.5=20
billion.

Some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approve=
d=20
in March by the California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a=20
kilowatt-hour the largest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue=
=20
generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-ter=
m=20
power contracts and repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would b=
e=20
the largest municipal deal ever.

Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the Edison rescue=
=20
remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may need to seek a=20
separate rate hike to cover its costs.

As written, the contracts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk=
=20
away from them if he concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism=
=20
persists and crosses political lines.

Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers Union, and Jack=20
Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn.,=20
rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in separate=20
interviews, they sounded similar themes.

"If there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts, even if we have t=
o=20
pay damages, we'd be better off in the long run," Snyder said.

Stewart, like other business leaders, does not advocate abrogating the=20
contracts. But like many familiar with the terms, he hopes that some deals=
=20
can be renegotiated.

"They are problematic," he said.

In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the=
=20
next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC to agree within a=
=20
month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.

State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the=
=20
$13.4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Stre=
et=20
investors can be assured that they will be repaid.

"The state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale=
,"=20
he said. "We will move toward fiscal insolvency."

The so-called rate agreement, a draft of which was obtained by The Times,=
=20
would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than=
=20
just the principal and interest on the $13.4 billion in bonds. Consumers=20
would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to pay taxes, fees and other=20
as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by the Department of Water=20
Resources.

Additionally, the PUC would be obligated to approve payments for programs b=
y=20
which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use,=
=20
although the Legislature has not approved the programs and their details=20
remain to be worked out. The Department of Water Resources estimates the co=
st=20
to be $800 million, spread over this year and next.

"It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)=
=20
said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would require the commission=
=20
to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water Resources decides=
=20
to do."

"That is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office," he said.

'Dictatorial Power' Warning

Stewart of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it=
=20

"As skeptical as we are of the PUC process, at least there is a process,"=
=20
Stewart said, referring to the commission's procedures to set electricity=
=20
rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR just tells the PUC, 'This is what =
we=20
need,' and the PUC must approve it."

Others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the=20
extraordinary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the=
=20
Department of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so=
=20
deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to=20
consumers.

In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January created=
=20
"the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdictio=
n=20
of the PUC.

"There is no public power agency in California that is reviewed by the PUC,=

said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

Washington -- An administrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis and California energy officials, cast aside the state's cla=
im=20
that it is owed $8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and=
=20
called for further hearings to determine "hard numbers."=20
The judge, ending talks designed to settle the dispute between California a=
nd=20
power sellers, said the state and its cash-strapped utilities may owe more =
in=20
unpaid electricity bills than they are owed for overcharges by the=20
generators.=20
The comments by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative l=
aw=20
Judge Curtis L. Wagner, although a strong endorsement of the generators'=20
position, seemed to indicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue=
=20
before it reached the five-member regulatory commission.=20
"There are refunds due (to California) that total hundreds of millions of=
=20
dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wagner said yesterday.=20
"At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from the California=20
Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities in the state o=
f=20
California that probably are higher than any overcharges that (the state) m=
ay=20
come up with."=20
Now, it will be up to the federal regulators to settle the case. But the=20
recommendations by Wagner, who mediated the talks, carry significant weight=
=20
with the commission and cast doubt on the state's chances of collecting the=
=20
full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.=20
The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings to=
=20
calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearings=
=20
would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60=20
days, Wagner said.=20
CLOSING SESSION
Wagner made his comments in the closing session of the 15-day talks, which=
=20
were ordered last month by the regulatory commission to try to defuse the=
=20
dispute between power wholesalers and California officials before it reache=
d=20
the courts.=20
The judge's message was a sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by Californi=
a=20
leaders -- especially Davis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime les=
s=20
than $8.9 billion for California's consumers.=20
The governor issued a statement shortly after the close of talks insisting=
=20
that California had won its basic case that the state is owed refunds.=20
"I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodology for calculating=20
refunds and rejected the generators' position that no refunds are due," Dav=
is=20
said.=20
The governor's chief representative at the talks, Michael Kahn, called the=
=20
judge's statement a "ringing endorsement" of the state's call for refunds.=
=20
Kahn said the judge's order would improve the state's legal position if it=
=20
files suit against power sellers.=20
GENERATORS FAVORED
But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.=20
For example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8.=
 9=20
billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though th=
e=20
regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 2000=
=20
could be considered.=20
The judge said yesterday that he would stick with the October date, meaning=
=20
that more than a third of the state's claim -- at least $3 billion -- would=
=20
not be refunded by the commission.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North=20
America, said that under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for=
=20
$1 billion to $1.5 billion.=20
"Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California has been=20
saying, it's a victory," Bailey said of the judge's statement.=20
But Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with =
a=20
serious offer.=20
"Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billion=
s=20
of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith," Davis said.=
=20
$716 MILLION OFFER=20
Wagner disclosed yesterday that the generators had made an offer to=20
California: $716 million in refunds.=20
The judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Bi=
g=20
Five generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6=20
million by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six=20
California municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-stat=
e=20
power sellers.=20
California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it included =
no=20
cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of the state=
's=20
debt off the books.=20
Throughout the talks, generators complained that the California team was=20
trying to shield some California companies and government power providers=
=20
from having to pay any refunds, and trying to disproportionately extract su=
ms=20
from out-of-state power companies.=20
FAVORITISM CHARGED
According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to remove Pacifi=
c=20
Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric.=
,=20
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other government power=20
suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refunds, even though=
=20
they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone else.=20
Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis made a=
=20
political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to compromise =
on=20
the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputation=20
would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.=20
"The California delegation did not come into these talks with any willingne=
ss=20
to compromise," said Mark Stultz, vice president of the Electric Power Supp=
ly=20
Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group. "They went in with a dollar=
=20
figure and never budged on that figure. If you're looking for a settlement,=
=20
you have to be willing to compromise."=20
Up next 1. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will consider, probably=

on July 25,=20
new hearings on how much, if anything, California was overcharged. 2. If=20

Gov. Gray Davis celebrated the startup of a new power plant in Pittsburg=20
yesterday -- the latest in a string of openings Davis hopes will help=20
California "build its way" out of the energy crisis. The state rushed to=20
throw as many megawatts on line as it could when it looked like the summer=
=20
would feature regular blackouts, and yesterday the governor said it was=20
paying off.=20
"This is the third plant I've helped open in the last 13 days," Davis said,=
=20
pumping his fist as the Calpine Corp. plant belched an impressive burst of=
=20
steam. "In the past 13 days, we've put more power on the grid than Californ=
ia=20
did throughout the 1990s."=20
The 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center and the Sutter Energy Center tha=

Calpine opened in Yuba City last week bring a total of 1,115 megawatts=20
online. Last month, Davis threw the switch on a Bakersfield plant that open=
ed=20
more than a month ahead of schedule.=20
Davis used yesterday's event to blast out-of-state generators that he=20
maintains have gouged the state for electricity. Yet he lauded San Jose-bas=
ed=20
Calpine as a sort of energy favorite son.=20
"They were the first to enter long-term contracts with us," the governor=20
said. Calpine is among the big energy firms being pressed by the state to=
=20
issue refunds for what the governor insists were overcharges, but unlike th=
e=20
others, Davis said, Calpine is giving ground in negotiations.=20
"They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us," he said.=
=20
Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of efficient new gas-=
=20
fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to run than their=
=20
forebears, the state will be paying well above current market rates for the=
=20
first three months of its contract with Calpine.=20
Calpine President Peter Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is n=
ot=20
making excess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide th=
e=20
electricity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July targ=
et=20
date, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232=
 a=20
megawatt hour when market rates were higher, he said.=20
In addition to the 300 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will=
=20
supply electricity to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other=
=20
power agencies.=20
In the long term, Calpine will be selling power to California at $59 a=20
megawatt hour, Cartwright said.=20
A spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which started buyi=
ng=20
power in January after state utilities buckled under high prices, said=20
Calpine's rate is well below the $70 a megawatt hour the state is aiming fo=

as an average price for the long-term contracts.=20
Cartwright said that with its recently opened plants, along with an 875-=20
megawatt facility it plans to open in Pittsburg next May, the company is=20
doing its share to ease the state's supply crunch.=20
"Ours are the lowest contracts in the state," he said. "If these plants=20
weren't online, we'd be having blackouts."=20
A spokeswoman from the state agency that manages the power grid said=20
California is skating so close to blackouts that "every megawatt counts."=

Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of=
=20
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power=20
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share=
=20
of the money went elsewhere.=20
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of=20
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private=
=20
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest.=20
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the=20
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting=
=20
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas.=20
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting=
=20
against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure and=20
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most=
=20
of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May.=20
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, sayin=

the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generator=

who have also gouged California.=20
"Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across=20

spokesman.=20
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state=20

About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys ar=

Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most=

that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recov=

Despite a power-related mishap that released toxic fumes from an industrial=

The county Health Department report found that 52 industrial facilities hav=

a freak traffic accident that knocked out power at Richmond's General=20
Chemical Corp. plant. When the plant powered back up, a cloud of sulfur=20
trioxide and sulfur dioxide was released.=20
Contra Costa hazardous materials director Lew Pascalli said that there is=

Denny Larson, spokesman for the group Communities for a Better Environment,=

said the report relied too heavily on industry self-reporting.=20
"Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report can't be backed up by the=20
facts," Larson said. "Oil and chemical plants in Contra Costa have repeated=

Power suppliers, state fail to agree on refund total=20

Mercury News Washington Bureau=20


WASHINGTON -- California officials and power suppliers failed to agree on=
=20
refunds for electricity overcharges as 15 days of contentious negotiations=
=20
ended Monday, leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said t=
he=20
state is owed much less than the $8.9 billion it demands.=20
The judge overseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
put the refunds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion=20
dollars. His estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power=
=20
suppliers during negotiations. The offer was rejected by California=20
officials.=20
But it was unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would=20
prevail, and California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed =
to=20
court. At stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimate=
ly=20
have to pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system=
=20
collapsed.=20
Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will=20
recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating=
=20
back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=
s=20
such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the=20
energy suppliers had advocated during the talks.=20
Michael Kahn, who headed the California negotiating team, said the state=20
would contest some aspects of the formula. But even without changes, Kahn=
=20
said he was confident the formula will result in more refunds than Wagner=
=20
estimated.=20
``We think the numbers even using the judge's formula are going to be in th=
e=20
multiple billions,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System=20
Operator, which runs the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9=
=20
billion dollars. If we don't get all of it from the commission .?.?. we'll=
=20
still get the remainder of the money'' through the courts.=20
Amount in dispute=20
Power industry representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.=20
``We haven't gone and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere nea=
r=20
the $8.9 billion,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel=
=20
for Duke Energy North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky=
=20
number that nobody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate=
=20
number.''=20
Wagner acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula,=20
saying he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the=20
suppliers.=20
The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last month=
=20
when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity=20
prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that unde=
r=20
pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the pow=
er=20
suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigation.=
=20
But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal,=20
participants said.=20
``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on one end and you s=
aw=20
$716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to splitting the=20
difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties genuinely wanted =
to=20
settle. Others didn't.''=20
Wagner now has until Monday to make his recommendation to the five-member=
=20
commission, which will make the final ruling on refunds. To date, the=20
commission has ordered $125 million in refunds for periods since last Oct. =
2.=20
Wagner said Monday that he will ask that a special hearing be set up in the=
=20
next 60 days to get the detailed information from the state and power=20
suppliers needed to determine a refund total using his formula.=20
The state may not end up with any cash, as any refund total could be applie=
d=20
to the several billion dollars California and its utilities still owe many =
of=20
the power suppliers.=20
Reflecting the tone of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Mond=
ay=20
blamed power suppliers for the failure of the talks and challenged the=20
commission to resolve the situation.=20
``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billio=
ns=20
of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team=
=20
in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past the FERC has shown=
=20
little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have the opportunity to=20
redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California has demonstrated=
=20
it is owed.''=20
Davis may go to court=20
At the opening of a new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis=
=20
told reporters that he's prepared to take the power generators to court if=
=20
FERC doesn't order the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of=
=20
$8.9 billion doesn't represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates=
=20
put the figure as high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about=
=20
how those figures were calculated.=20
John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, sa=
id=20
the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.9 billion figure.=20
California officials and several suppliers said they would continue to=20
negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Calpine said his=
=20
company is close to a settlement with the state.=20
Power suppliers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energ=
y=20
commissions' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner=
=20
said he will do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed=
=20
for it. Wagner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan tha=
t=20
power suppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State=
=20
officials wanted it to cover up to May 2000.=20
$3 billion difference=20
The state's $8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001.=20
Factoring refunds beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion =
in=20
overcharges the state says occurred in the earlier period.=20
Among the changes to the commission's formula that Wagner made was to revis=
e=20
the way the prevailing electricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants=
=20
the price limit determined for each hour of each day. The commission's=20
formula sets a price limit during Stage One power emergencies that remains =
in=20
effect until the next emergency.=20
But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University economi=
st=20
Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge will=20
produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.=20
``That's the methodology the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the=20
California ISO on market issues. ``By using the marginal unit for each hour=

you'll get refund numbers on the order of what the state estimated.''=20

according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a=20
legal dispute over public access to the data.=20

The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that hav=

The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that Davis has=20

utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the=20
price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for=
=20
what prompted the decrease.=20
In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market wa=

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's=

assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the=

out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant=20
shift of money out of California.''=20
But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration=
=20
contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by=

the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the Davis administration=
=20
panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for=

Used for support=20
Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks=20
against Davis, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power=20
generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down,=

partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many=20
plants.=20
``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,''=

said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt=

The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy=20

Refund outlook dims=20
Talks break down; judge says state is owed much less than its $8.9 billion=
=20
demand -- and unpaid bills may offset gains.=20
July 10, 2001=20
By DENA BUNIS
and JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register=20
WASHINGTON The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is=
=20
owed maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the=
=20
$8.9 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis.=20
And even at that, said Judge Curtis Wagner, the electricity sellers are owe=
d=20
so much more in unpaid power bills that in the end California might not see=
=20
one red cent.=20
Wagner announced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission after two weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the partie=
s=20
to California's electricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now i=
n=20
the commissioners' hands.=20
Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 million in=20
refunds, an offer the state rejected. "I don't think it's 8.9 (billion=20
dollars)," he said afterwards, "because I haven't been shown that it was."=
=20
For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds is =
a=20
dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased power. An=
d=20
the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of warding off=
=20
future rate increases.=20
"California will get its $8.9 billion," insisted Michael Kahn, head of the=
=20
state's delegation and the California Independent System Operator. Kahn=20
brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory in the judge's assertion tha=
t=20
the state is owed some refunds, a concept the generators have been unwillin=
g=20
to embrace up to now, he said.=20
Since the talks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week=
=20
Duke Energy offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed=
=20
their refund offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the=
=20
company were dropped.=20
But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that California i=
s=20
no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price gouging by power=
=20
companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks began.=20
And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the FERC. If=
=20
unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for years.=20
"You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink," Wagner said duri=
ng=20
an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommendation. H=
e=20
has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points during the=20
often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators and trie=
d=20
to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unprecedented Sunday=
=20
session.=20
"The numbers were too far apart," Wagner said.=20
While Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's=
=20
comments, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them "barely better=
=20
than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick." Burton agreed with Kahn that the=
=20
state has to do all it can to get more than that.=20
And Davis backed up his team.=20
"Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there wer=
e=20
overcharges made because the market was broken," Davis said. "Remarkably, t=
he=20
energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibility t=
o=20
the people of California and own up to their profiteering."=20
Power generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John=
=20
Stout, vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's "fundamental=20
position has been and remains that no refunds are justified."=20
Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's=20
recommendation, "a fair one."=20
Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed=
=20
energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced=
=20
themselves from the state's refund request.=20
"I don't believe there really exists a true justification for that number,"=
=20
said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. "I've never considered that=20
anything more than a wild number to throw out there."=20
The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of overcharges because th=
ey=20
are using different assumptions about how to compute the complex pricing=20
structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the majority of the generator=
s'=20
methods.=20
To start with, the state is asking for $8.9 billion, but about $3 billion o=
f=20
those alleged overcharges happened between May and October 2000, a period=
=20
FERC is not looking at. FERC issued two refund orders in March, finding tha=
t=20
power companies had $124 million in overcharges during power alerts. But th=
e=20
state is challenging that finding, saying there were overcharges beyond tho=
se=20
limited times. And the state is also asking FERC to reconsider allowing=20
refunds for May to October 2000.=20
How energy panel affects California=20
Six months ago, few people had heard of FERC. Now the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission, the agency charged with making sure that the nation'=
s=20
power markets are running smoothly and that wholesale prices are "just and=
=20
reasonable," rolls off the tongue.=20
The five commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their=
=20
home state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks th=
at=20
concluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's=
=20
electricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term=
=20
power contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months.=
=20
FERC's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.=20
WHAT WAS AT STAKE?=20
For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amount power=
=20
companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's finding? There=
=20
should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.=20
For the generators: More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for=20
unpaid power bills. Wagner's finding? Generators are owed more money than t=
he=20
refunds they owe California. He did not specify by how much.=20
For California consumers: A stable electricity market. Until the refund iss=
ue=20
is settled and power prices are stabilized long term, what the future holds=
=20
for rate increase remains uncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement.=20
Consumers still in limbo.=20
HOW DID WE GET HERE?=20
In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The state began=20
appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the utilities we=
re=20
running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the electricity they=
=20
sold. Rolling blackouts began.=20
Starting in January, the state began buying the power, replacing the=20
near-bankrupt utilities. Politicians from Sacramento to Washington increase=
d=20
the pressure on FERC to cap rates. More than $27 billion was spent to buy=
=20
power for California last year, compared with $7 billion the year before. T=
he=20
price tag could reach $50 billion this year.=20
On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps experts say could=20
moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but the caps hav=
e=20
caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some power off the=

market.=20
WHAT'S NEXT?=20
The FERC commissioners will receive Wagner's report within a week. In it, h=
e=20
will suggest they hold a fast-track formal hearing that would last no more=

than 60 days.=20
If they agree, after that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and=

other California market issues.=20
If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagree, they can=

contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could last many=20
years.

$100 million, according to a report released by state power traders.=20
The California Department of Water Resources released the report Monday,=20
along with 1,770 pages of documents that also detailed the last- minute pow=

purchases the state made on the spot market in the first three months of th=

The report details the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, whe=
n=20
the state took over electricity purchases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., S=
an=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co., and Southern California Edison.=20
The utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy=
=20
enough to purchase power. Since then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion=
=20
to keep the lights on.=20
The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The=20
second-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.=
=20
But since May, spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate=20
weather, lower natural gas prices, increased conservation that lowered dema=
nd=20
and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into=20
possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray Davis has said long-term contracts=
=20
also drove the price down.=20
"It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down, but it=20
looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis,=20
spokesman for Assembly Republicans.=20
The slight reduction in spot-market prices "underscores questions about the=
=20
strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, if natural gas prices=20
continue to drop," Fisfis said.=20
Most of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20=
=20
years.=20
Davis already has released details of the state's long-term power contracts=
=20
after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several news=20

The newly released short-term contracts also show that on March 19-20, when=

For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatt-hours at off-peak usage tim=

California and Generators Still Split After 2-Week Talks

WASHINGTON, July 9 -- A federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiations=20
about California 's demands for electricity refunds today, with the state a=
nd=20
power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the talks=20
began.=20
The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong=
=20
dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which the mediator=
=20
may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of about $1 billion=
.=20
California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it would seek that=
=20
much and more, through the courts if necessary.=20
Although electricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the pow=
er=20
crisis that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikel=
y=20
to be resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity shoul=
d=20
have cost during the last 13 months.=20
The power market has been mired in an accounting gridlock. The state claims=
=20
that generating companies began grossly overcharging for electricity -- wit=
h=20
prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 20 over year-before levels -- beginning=
=20
in late spring last year. Generators say they are prepared to pay some=20
refunds, but argue that California 's estimates of overcharges are radicall=
y=20
inflated.=20
The mediator in the settlement talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an=20
administrative law judge for the federal agency, who said today that the=20
negotiations had failed to reach the comprehensive voluntary settlement he=
=20
had sought.=20
Mr. Wagner said he would recommend to the agency's commissioners that they=
=20
convene a 60-day evidentiary hearing that would impose an administrative=20
solution. He also said he would suggest a method for determining fair price=
s=20
for electricity .=20
Under federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''jus=
t=20

r=20
that California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently beg=
an=20
imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations of=
=20
past overcharges systematically.=20
While the scope of any refunds remains uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks=20
appeared more favorable for generators than for Western states, which have=
=20
collectively pressed for as much as $15 billion in refunds.=20
Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California should have paid for=
=20
power since last September, when the commission began monitoring California=
=20
energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroactively apply a price=
=20
control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated that he supported a w=
ay=20
of calculating the costs of power generation that is closer to the method=
=20
favored by power companies than to the one put forward by California=20
officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recommending could=20
require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''maybe a billion''=
=20
dollars.=20
California officials gave a positive cast to the judge's statements, callin=
g=20
them a step forward because he formally acknowledged that companies would=
=20
have to pay some refunds. They also noted that whatever the level of=20
federally mandated refunds, they would have the option of seeking more in=

court.=20
''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' said Michael Kahn, who=20
represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talks. ''If we don't get i=
t=20
all from the commission, we will get the remainder in the courts.''=20
Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did not provide refund=
s=20
in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue generators for $18=
=20
billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generators, mostly out of=20
state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said, speaking at the=
=20
ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California .=20
Representatives of several generating companies said that during the=20
settlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500=
=20
million. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge=
=20
would result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their=

offer than to California 's demand.=20
Still, several executives said they now hoped to reach individual settlemen=

and its leading, financially pressed utilities, which ran up huge debts to=

"The numbers were too far apart," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the=

told reporters. "There's an old southern saying," said the 72-year-old=20
Tennessean. "You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."=
=20
He declined to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted=20
California officials for not modifying their initial demands.=20
Wagner said he will send his own refund formula to FERC's five commissioner=

The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considerable weight with FERC=

Mark,

I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora 
Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other 
than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.

We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on 
the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us 
in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been 
involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff 
Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here 
and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues.

Cheers
Scott

Scott,

in Cynthia's absence, can you allocate someone else from your group to 
oversee this? As you can see, we are in need of some immediate assistance on 
Whitewing.

Did you get the chance to speak to Mike Jakubik about Margaux? Can you help 
out with Houston coordination or shall I just get on with it with Mark Taylor 
and Jeff Hodge?

Thanks.

Subject: Margaux/Whitewing


Ron/Trina/Ben,

I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing 
and determine what the appropriate course of action is.  

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been 
updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the 
synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by 
which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity 
interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of 
Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which 
are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with 
ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount 
representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making 
a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment 
from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things 
happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of 
the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) 
raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, 
purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In 
other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its 
receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash 
proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a 
floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram 
below.

With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  
The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from 
Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from 
Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, 
is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need 
to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the 
definition of "Indebtedness" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP 
Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE 
Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into 
issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they 
will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of 
who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss 
the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to 
open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to 
revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy 
task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need 
to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require 
Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A 
final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be 
responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.

More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with 
respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?

If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll 
be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time 
discussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next 
week.

Best regards,

Stuart

Subject: Margaux - Whitewing Partnership amendment

As you may recall, the tax comments to the debt term sheet reflected a need 
for an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement to admit ENA as a 
partner. You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for 
legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such 
amendment.  So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you 
please consider the following:

1. Have any legal/accounting/other issues been identified as resulting from 
an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement?

2. If so, what are the potential solutions to any such issues?

3. Have definite conclusions been reached regarding the economics of ENA's 
preferred return on the Whitewing interest, such that a draft of the 
necessary partnership allocations can be undertaken?

4. Has a decision been made regarding who will be charged with drafting the 
amendments?  Will it be the Margaux legal team?  The Houston Global Finance 
legal group?  Other??

Thanks, in advance, for your consideration of these issues.

Kindest Regards,

Mark,

I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora 
Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other 
than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.

We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on 
the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us 
in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been 
involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff 
Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here 
and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues.

Cheers

Scott,

in Cynthia's absence, can you allocate someone else from your group to 
oversee this? As you can see, we are in need of some immediate assistance on 
Whitewing.

Did you get the chance to speak to Mike Jakubik about Margaux? Can you help 
out with Houston coordination or shall I just get on with it with Mark Taylor 
and Jeff Hodge?

Thanks.

Subject: Margaux/Whitewing


Ron/Trina/Ben,

I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing 
and determine what the appropriate course of action is.  

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been 
updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the 
synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by 
which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity 
interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of 
Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which 
are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with 
ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount 
representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making 
a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment 
from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things 
happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of 
the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) 
raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, 
purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In 
other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its 
receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash 
proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a 
floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram

Lodi, population 57,000, is refusing to participate in the rolling blackout=

that have swept across California. Four times since March, Lodi's electric=

The rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival once derided Lodi as a=20

"Lodi has something of an independent streak," said Steve Mann, a former ci=

"It doesn't make sense that we should participate in blackouts when we have=

done everything we can to make sure we can avoid that."=20
So far, Lodi has the only utility in the state to openly defy an on-the-spo=
t=20
call for blackouts. They did so twice in March, then twice again this month=
.=20
This week, however, Riverside's utility said it, too, would not participate=
=20
in forced outages, and leaders of some other "munis" may follow suit.=20
Worried about a political snowball, Gov. Gray Davis met with leaders of the=
=20
munis last week, but refused to exempt them from further blackouts. If that=
=20
happened, the state's power managers would be unable to spread blackouts to=

25 percent of the state's households, putting the brunt on other parts of t=

state.=20
"I'm sympathetic," said David Freeman, the governor's top energy adviser an=

a former leader of municipal utilities in Sacramento and Los Angeles. But=
=20
Freeman, speaking with uncharacteristic guardedness, said it may not be=20
practical "to separate out utilities that are an integral part of the grid.=
"=20
The self-proclaimed "wine grape capital of the world," Lodi would seem an=
=20
unlikely hotbed for dissent. Creedence Clearwater once bemoaned being "stuc=
k=20
in Lodi." Instead of being offended by the song, many residents are glad=20
their town isn't inhabited by a bunch of long-haired rabble-rousers.=20
Even so, Lodi likes to defy convention when it comes to protecting its own.=
=20
Two years ago, the city started waging battle against big insurance compani=
es=20
that didn't want to pay to clean up toxic substances from local businesses=
=20
that had trickled into water supplies.=20
In recent years, Lodi has spent millions sprucing up its once-dilapidated=
=20
downtown, which soon will be crowned by a new 12-screen cineplex.=20
But the town's biggest source of pride is its taxpayer-owned utility, which=
=20
started in the 1890s when two brothers, Ed and Fred Carey, launched a water=
=20
and electric utility. In 1910, they sold it to the city of Lodi for $35,000=
.=20
Now, the utility provides $4 million to the town's coffers every year, with=
 a=20
$30 million annual budget.=20
Like many other municipal utilities in Northern California, Lodi has more=
=20
power lined up than it needs, but is dependent on Pacific Gas and Electric=
=20
Co. to deliver that power to its doorstep.=20
As a result, "Lodi's relationship with PG&E has been tenuous throughout its=
=20
history," said Mann. One point of contention is the interconnection agreeme=
nt=20
among PG&E, Lodi and the town's fellow members in the Northern California=
=20
Power Agency.=20
PG&E officials say the agreement requires Lodi to shed power during any pow=
er=20
shortfall. But Lodi contends the pact obligates the utility to impose=20
blackouts only during "physical emergencies," such as a wind storm that=20
knocks out transformers.=20
"We don't see any compelling reason why Lodi should have to participate in=
=20
rolling blackouts," said Alan Vallow, director of the city's utility. "You=
=20
want me to turn customers off when we have the capacity to keep them on? Th=
at=20
doesn't work for me."=20
During a statewide call for blackouts, PG&E conceivably could just switch o=
ff=20
power for Lodi if the city's utility didn't heed the call voluntarily. But=
=20
Vallow doubts PG&E would take such a step. "That would be pretty extreme," =
he=20
said.=20
An engineer who used to work for Los Angeles' utility, Vallow has become=20
"something of a folk hero" because of his stance, said Mann. Vallow is=20
especially popular with Lodi's canneries, which need reliable power in the=
=20
summer to pack fruit before it rots in the field. And most Lodites "are 100=
=20
percent behind Mr. Vallow," said Marie Saunders, a longtime local resident.=
=20
On the other hand, Lodi's City Council hasn't officially endorsed Vallow's=
=20
decision, giving it an out should PG&E or state officials seek revenge.=20
"If we weren't supportive, we would let Alan know," said Alan Nakanishi, th=
e=20
mayor of Lodi. "On the other hand, if we do get retribution, we may say to=
=20
Al, 'Hey, what is all this about?' "=20
So far, PG&E hasn't threatened any action against Lodi, but experts say the=
=20
town is venturing into murky legal territory.=20
"It is a legal question that hasn't been resolved," said John Fistolera,=20
legislative director of the Northern California Power Agency, a group of=20
municipal utilities that includes Lodi.=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which is not part of NCPA, also=
=20
has taken a cautious approach. Earlier this year, at least one SMUD board=
=20
member recommended the utility follow Lodi's example. But the idea was=20
dropped amid fears that SMUD, being a bigger utility, could face a legal=20
fight that PG&E wouldn't mount against little Lodi.=20
"I really admire what Lodi has done," said Linda Davis, a SMUD board member=
.=20
"But I don't want to end up in court, and I fear SMUD would end up in court=
."=20
Instead of an open rebellion, SMUD has joined the Southern California town =
of=20
Vernon and 13 other cities in appealing to the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission. They want FERC to exempt them from blackouts ordered by the=20
state's grid manager, the Independent System Operator.=20
ISO officials argue that "load shedding" from the municipal utilities is=20
vital for maintaining balance on the grid during shortfalls. But SMUD and t=
he=20
other municipalities say they shouldn't be penalized for lining up power=20
reserves that have eluded the state's big utilities, especially with the=20
state facing dozens of blackouts this summer.=20
"Like Vernon, SMUD has grave concerns over the prospect of sharply escalati=
ng=20
the number and duration of blackout occurrences directed by the ISO on a=20
grid-wise basis over the upcoming summer months," SMUD wrote to FERC.=20
Last week, the Riverside City Council voted to stop participating in=20
blackouts ordered by the ISO. Like Lodi, Riverside says its conservation=20
programs should be taken into account in ISO's attempts to deal with power=
=20
shortages.=20
Vallow says Lodi has done everything it can to help the state. In January,=
=20
the city complied with blackout orders, then purchased long-term contracts=
=20
that gave it a 40 percent surplus in power reserves.=20
To pay for those reserves, the utility increased customer rates by as much =
as=20
15 percent.=20
Since then, the city has sold excess power back to the state to help with=
=20
shortages. But Vallow also has told the state that Lodi will not participat=
e=20
in further blackouts.=20
Vallow calls it the "SET" program, which stands for "System, Electric suppl=

"We've done everything the state should have done to avoid the crisis we ar=

Bush, Davis on collision course=20



President, Cheney firm: No price caps

COPLEY NEWS SERVICE=20
May 27, 2001=20
WASHINGTON -- When President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis meet this week to=20
discuss California's power crisis, it will be a close-up clash of ideologie=
s=20
that until now have been playing out long distance.=20
To Californians struggling with rolling blackouts and skyrocketing power=20
bills, Bush's allegiance to free-market principles and his rejection of=20
electricity price controls can seem baffling -- if not payback for the=20
state's vote against him in the presidential election.=20
Yet a look at the record shows that Bush and his energy czar, Vice Presiden=
t=20
Dick Cheney, share an unshakable faith in open power markets shaped by=20
conservative politics and their long association with an industry that has=
=20
benefited greatly from deregulation.

It is a view fortified by energy company executives who enjoy easy access t=
o=20
top administration officials and counsel against measures like price=20
controls. One company in particular, power marketer Enron Corp., appears to=
=20
wield great influence with the White House on energy policy.=20
Davis argues that because the deregulation plan adopted by the state in 199=
6=20
turned out to be deeply flawed, a truly free market doesn't exist. Power=20
marketers and generators now have enough leverage to charge, on average, mo=
re=20
than $330 per megawatt-hour of electricity, 10 times what they were getting=
=20

Temporary Western price controls -- based on the cost of producing the powe=
r=20
and a hefty, built-in profit margin for the power sellers -- would provide =
a=20
respite until the problems are fixed, Davis contends. A recent Field Poll=
=20
shows that an overwhelming majority of Californians, Republican and Democra=
t,=20
share that view.=20
"It would be a grave mistake for the Bush administration to allow rigid=20
ideology to stand in the way of doing what's best for our country," a=20
frustrated Davis said recently. "Deregulation is not a religion."=20
The White House flatly denies it is looking at the issue with ideological=

blinders on, or through an energy industry prism. Bush and other=20
administration officials argue that price controls have a proven history of=
=20
backfiring -- drying up energy supplies at the same time they encourage mor=
e=20
consumption.=20
"The president and this administration do not support price caps because th=
ey=20
don't work," said White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan.=20
The folly of price controls is an article of faith in the oil industry, whi=
ch=20
was long subjected to them. Both Bush and Cheney prospered in that industry=
.=20
Bush founded an oil company in his native West Texas in 1977, shortly after=
=20
graduating from business school. Arbusto Energy didn't find much oil, but=
=20
Bush profited greatly in the boom-and-bust industry through mergers with=20
bigger industry players.=20
Before Bush plucked him out of the private sector, Cheney headed Halliburto=
n=20
Co., a leading oil-field services firm based in Dallas.=20
"I think there's no doubt that their views have been shaped by their=20
backgrounds in the industry and their broader ideological views about=20
markets," said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.=20
Cheney in particular has expressed a visceral aversion to price controls. H=
is=20
experience helping to craft broad wage and price limits in the Nixon=20
administration left an indelible mark.=20
"The night the control regulations went to the Federal Register to be=20
published, they were 14 pages long. I know, because I typed them," Cheney=
=20
said recently. "When we got through a couple years later, we had a roomful =
of=20
regulations."=20
The price controls aggravated the oil shortage that plunged the nation into=
=20
an energy crisis in the 1970s, Cheney argues.=20
"You could control domestic oil prices, but you couldn't control the price =
of=20
imports that were set by the international market. .?.?. A lot of companies=
=20
shut down, quit producing domestically," he said.=20
The new breed of power generators and marketers spawned by the nationwide=

including an admonition that the administration "should reject any attempt =
to=20
re-regulate wholesale power markets" with price caps or other controls.=20
Davis, by contrast, was invited to simply submit a one-page memo to the=20
energy task force, his spokesman said.=20
Lay also reportedly advised the Bush administration on appointments to the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The commission has the power to impos=

price controls, but has so far balked at Davis' proposal.=20
Enron's clout with the administration has stoked the suspicions of critics.=

"It's Lay that drives the policy," said Craig McDonald, director of Texans=

for Public Justice, which tracks political spending in that state.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer dismissed such talk as "outrageous."=20

?????The hotel--which no longer offers lodging, just food and drink, and=20
plenty of it--is bustling these days with the roustabout energy of a Lone=
=20
Star construction camp. Just down the road, a mammoth electrical power plan=
t=20
is rising out of the sagebrush, its generators housed in four boxy building=
s=20
the size of airplane hangars.
?????It is one of six new major gas-fired power plants expected to be built=
=20
in Kern County over the next several years, an electrical construction boom=
=20
unmatched anywhere in California. Kern, which already has a large surplus o=
f=20
electricity, is cementing its place as California's energy capital, assumin=
g=20
far more than its share of the burden in recharging the state's drained pow=
er=20
supplies.
?????Over the next several years, the county will add nearly 5,000 megawatt=
s=20
of power to the statewide grid. That is more than California now imports, o=
n=20
average, from out-of-state suppliers. It's enough to supply about five=20
counties the size of Kern, which fills the dusty southern rim of the San=20
Joaquin Valley and has a population of 662,000.
?????In some parts of the state, a proposal to build a new power plant is a=
=20
call to throw up the barricades. In recent months, intense community=20
opposition has forced developers to pull back proposals to build major plan=
ts=20
in South Gate and San Jose, although Gov. Gray Davis has tried to revive=20
plans for the San Jose plant.
?????You don't hear a lot of not-in-my-backyard talk in Kern County.
?????"There should be power plants in everybody's backyard," said Paul Gipe=
,=20
chairman of the Kern chapter of the Sierra Club, which did not oppose any o=
f=20
the new plants. "If people are concerned about having too many power plants=
,=20
they should think twice when they flip on the light switch."
?????New, natural gas-fired power plants, Gipe reasoned, are relatively cle=
an=20
and will not add significantly to the county's serious air pollution=20
problems. Ideally, he said, they will allow the state to close some older,=
=20
dirtier plants that cause considerably more environmental damage.
?????If environmentalists don't oppose the plants, it's not too much of a=
=20
leap to guess that some people might be positively thrilled about them.
?????Just try, for instance, asking somebody in Taft, an oil center south o=
f=20
McKittrick. "It's more money coming into Kern County--that's the way I look=
=20
at it," said Pamela Dunlap, who runs a downtown thrift shop.

?????An Economy Rooted in the Oil Industry
?????She stood in the twilight outside her shop, on a street that embodies=
=20
many of the most attractive attributes of small town Americana--with one=20
small difference. Where some towns might have statues of their founders or=
=20
war heroes in prominent public places, Taft has erected small oil rigs and=
=20
other pieces of drilling machinery, a reminder of its economic roots.
?????That Kern County has stepped up as California's blackout-buster is,=20
perhaps, not surprising.
?????To begin with, there's geography. Kern stands astride California's maj=
or=20
north-south electrical transmission lines at precisely the spot at which th=
ey=20
divide between the service areas of Pacific Gas & Electric, which serves=20
Northern California, and Southern California Edison. That spot can be=20
pinpointed as the Midway substation, a vast jungle of humming wires,=20
transformers and circuit breakers that lies a short distance west of=20
Interstate 5 in the town of Buttonwillow.
?????Already, massive new circuit-breakers--they look like Frankenstein=20
helmets sprouting 5-foot-long sparkplugs--are being erected at Midway to=20
handle the power from two major plants that will be revving up in the comin=
g=20
months: PG&E National Energy's La Paloma plant, the one near McKittrick; an=
d=20
Edison Mission Energy's Sunrise plant, just south of Taft.
?????The county is served by two major natural gas pipelines, which will be=
=20
tapped to run the plants. In fact, Kern contains the state's largest known=
=20
reservoirs of natural gas.
?????Another of Kern's geographic advantages?
?????"You look around, and you'll see there aren't a lot of people living=
=20
around here," observed Stephen Whaley, who is overseeing construction of th=
e=20
Sunrise plant. In the surrounding hills, an orchard of oil rigs bobbed in t=
he=20
morning haze. Dirt roads cut crudely across the landscape, bisecting a=20
crisscross of steam pipes, fuel lines and electrical wires.
?????"This area is all about oil," Whaley said. Casting a glance at the=20
modular 560-megawatt plant rising behind him, he added with a wry smile, "Y=
ou=20
know, I guess you could look at this from the road, and you could make the=
=20
argument that it improves the looks."
?????The Sunrise plant, a relatively simple single-cycle plant, is expected=
=20
to fire up 320 megawatts of its total output by Aug. 1, a scant nine months=
=20
after construction began. The other plants--more complex and efficient=20
dual-cycle operations--will be opening over the next several years, assumin=
g=20
all receive final approval.
?????The lack of major opposition to the plants is, of course, another reas=
on=20
developers see Kern County as a good place to build. The county has long ha=
d=20
a more intimate relationship with energy--oil, gas, electricity--than most=
=20
places. To people here, the link between a natural gas well and a lightbulb=

or an oil derrick and a gas pedal, is neither theoretical nor especially=20
threatening. They're comfortable with energy.

?????SACRAMENTO--Despite months of negotiations, Gov. Gray Davis' plan to=

save Southern California Edison, one of California's biggest utilities, is=
=20
effectively dead in the state Legislature, leaders of both houses now agree=
.
?????Not only has Davis failed to garner support for his more than $3-billi=

=20
to fashion an alternative are also falling flat. As a result, any alternati=

proposal to rescue Edison will probably have to be approved on a party-line=
=20
vote by Democrats.
?????The reasons are complex, according to legislators working to close the=
=20
Edison deal, but ultimately come down to simple politics, and are emblemati=
c=20
of what has been a plodding, partisan response in the state Capitol to the=

energy crisis.
?????The stakes are high, because restoring Edison to financial health and=

requiring the utility to temporarily sell power at lower prices are linchpi=

of Davis' plan to get the state out of the business of buying electricity.
?????Nevertheless, leaders in the Legislature say Davis' approach has few=

backers.
?????"I don't think the governor's [plan] has support in either party in=20

issue is whether we can come up with something else, and I think we can."
?????Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), who has been critical of=

the deal Davis and Edison put together from the outset, said it is certainl=
y=20
dead in the Legislature, but that a more far-reaching proposal may still=20
emerge.
?????"Hopefully, we will find a long-term solution" to the state's energy=
=20
mess, Burton said. The Edison deal alone "is not going to solve anything. I=
t=20
is not going to reduce rates, and it is not going to prevent blackouts."
?????Since January, California has authorized more than $7 billion in=20
taxpayer money to buy power for private utilities in order to avoid mass=20
blackouts. It is a perilous fiscal situation that has drained the state=20
budget and led to downgrades of the state's credit rating on Wall Street.
?????Lawmakers are wary of making an even greater blunder than they did in=
=20
1996, when they unanimously approved what is now widely considered to be a=
=20
botched scheme to deregulate electricity in California. In both the Assembl=

and Senate, most Democrats and Republicans are convinced there is no way fo=
r=20
them to save Edison without appearing to sanction a huge bailout similar to=
=20
the federal government's rescue of Chrysler in 1980--one with less financia=

?????As a result, they all want to get something of value in return from=20
Edison--high-voltage transmission lines, hydroelectric power plants or=20
guarantees that the utility will boost energy supplies--but are sharply spl=

on what is best.
?????A core element of all Edison rescue programs being considered is a=20
proposal to use a chunk of customers' monthly electric bills to repay the=
=20
utility's huge debt, a solution many election-conscious legislators find as=
=20
appetizing as a suicide pill.

?????Consumer Activists Threaten Initiative
?????The deal only requires a majority vote, but without two-thirds approva=
l=20
it would be wide open to an initiative challenge--a prospect that frightens=

politicians. Consumer activists have already threatened to strike back with=
 a=20
referendum next year, when Davis and lawmakers will be seeking reelection.
?????Democrats, who hold majorities in both houses, cannot agree on how to=

save Edison--or whether it is even proper for government to do so. Some hav=
e=20
grown convinced that California would be better off letting Edison follow=

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. into U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Indeed, after PG&E=

filed for protection from creditors in Bankruptcy Court last month, and=20
massive blackouts failed to materialize, legislative momentum to save Ediso=

from a similar fate all but vanished.
?????"The urgency of doing anything on behalf of Edison is gone," said Sen.=

Don Perata (D-Alameda).
?????Meanwhile, Democratic efforts to forge a bipartisan solution with=20

plan. Legislative leaders realized early on that liberals and conservatives=

were unlikely to ever agree on details of a deal, so some Democrats and=20
Republicans attempted to form a centrist coalition. But the parties have=20

=20
over who is to blame for California's power problems grows ever more partis=
an.
?????Sensing they were being frozen out of negotiations, Assembly Republica=
ns=20
rolled out a rival proposal last week that was focused on increasing power=

supplies in exchange for the rescue. Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox=20
(R-Fair Oaks) said he had hoped to pursue a bipartisan solution, but,=20
"Regrettably, it appears that [the Legislature] is not moving in that=20
direction now."
?????The Republicans' decision surprised and angered members of the "Plan B=

Group," a loose-knit cadre of Democratic lawmakers that has been working wi=

Republicans to hash out an alternative to Davis' proposal. Members of the=
=20
group say they are close to unveiling a complex counterproposal that could=

 a=20
party-line basis.
?????Despite the setbacks, Davis and many lawmakers still say some form of=

the Edison rescue plan will clear the Senate and Assembly this summer. But=
=20
since Davis announced he had reached a deal with Edison executives to save=

the utility in April, nothing has been accomplished in the Legislature to=

?????The long delay is adding to the problem. Every day that passes increas=

?????The lack of progress also increases the chances that Edison, like PG&E=

?????Edison has ramped up its public relations efforts in recent weeks and=

has launched an aggressive multimedia campaign to pressure legislators into=

approving the deal, replete with firefighter testimonials on television and=

direct mail pitches to stockholders asking them to write their state=20
representatives.
?????The rescue deal Davis reached with Edison calls for the state to pay t=

utility $2.76 billion for its network of high-voltage transmission lines. I=
t=20
would allow the state to issue bonds to finance the purchase, and declares=
=20
that Edison is to use the money to pare down its debt, estimated at $3.5=20

?????Most important, the deal would set aside a portion of ratepayers'=20
monthly utility bills to pay off Edison's "undercollections," huge debts th=

?????In return, Edison would agree to sell the electricity it generates fro=

?????From the minute it was announced, however, lawmakers from both parties=

have called Davis' deal overly generous and questioned the benefit to the=

?????Republicans, who have opposed the takeover from the outset, are=20

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK
Bush Could Boost Green Power With Buying Power=20


By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????Today, the south wall of the Energy Department's fortress-like=20
Washington headquarters is a fitting symbol for an agency that itself has=
=20
never quite established an identity: a 32,100-square-foot blank slab of=20
concrete.
?????Shortly before leaving office, however, the Clinton administration=20
awarded a Chicago architectural firm a contract to explore converting the=
=20
wall into something quite different: a vast solar array that would provide=
=20
much of the building's heat and power.
?????The firm--Solomon Cordwell Buenz & Associates--has produced a=20
spectacular design of a graceful, canopy-like Sun Wall that utilizes both=
=20
photovoltaic panels and hydronic systems, a liquid-filled vacuum tube that=
=20
warms with the sun's rays and can heat the building in winter. Now the firm=
=20
is working to estimate the cost of constructing its creation. "We think it=
=20
would certainly draw attention to this whole new type of energy," says Mart=
in=20
Wolf, one of the designers. "Which would be quite timely given where we are=
=20
as a nation."
?????The Sun Wall stands as a riveting symbol of Washington's potential to=
=20
advance the development of renewable energy through a tool that's received=
=20
almost no attention in the energy debate: the purchasing power of the feder=
al=20
government itself. Through all its departments and agencies, the federal=20
government spends about $8 billion a year on energy--probably more than any=
=20
other single consumer in the world. That buying power gives the government=
=20
enormous leverage to speed the growth of renewable energy sources such as=
=20
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass.
?????Today, all of these renewable sources (leaving aside hydropower) provi=
de=20
only 2% to 3% of the nation's electricity, mostly because they are too=20
expensive to compete with conventional sources. Renewables are in the same=
=20
Catch-22 as many new technologies: Because they are too expensive, they=20
cannot attract the sales that their makers need to both generate economies =
of=20
scale and invest in more advanced manufacturing techniques.
?????Government can break the logjam by providing a market that allows=20
renewable manufacturers to advance up the learning curve and lower the pric=
e=20
of their technologies to a level that makes them commercially competitive.
?????Washington has done precisely this before, most important with a produ=
ct=20
that has literally transformed modern life: the microchip at the heart of t=
he=20
computer revolution. The first microchips were much too expensive to attrac=
t=20
commercial customers, but in the early 1960s, both NASA (using the chips fo=
r=20
the Apollo space program) and the Defense Department (embedding the chips i=
n=20
nuclear weapons) provided a guaranteed market--buying the chips without=20
regard to cost.
?????As author T.R. Reid recounted in "The Chip," his history of the=20
microchip: "The government's willingness to buy chips in quantity at premiu=
m=20
prices provided the money the semiconductor firms needed to hone their skil=
ls=20
in designing and producing [the] circuits. . . . As experience taught ways =
to=20
solve the most common production problems, the cost of making a chip began =
to=20
fall."
?????Three years after the government first started buying, the cost fell f=
ar=20
enough that the microchip attracted its first commercial customers. Its bee=
n=20
a breakneck race to the future ever since.
?????An alliance of centrist House Democrats has sensibly proposed that=20
Washington do the same for renewables. Earlier this month, the House New=20
Democrat Coalition introduced legislation that would commit the federal=20
government to purchasing a fixed percentage of its power from renewable=20
sources; the bill also would provide grants and loans to encourage state=20
governments and nonprofit organizations to also buy green. "Today, you can'=
t=20
generate the revenue to make these technologies more commercially viable,"=
=20
says Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), one of the bill's principal authors. "The w=
ay=20
to get around that is to use the market power of the federal government to=
=20
help create a market."
?????With little attention, former President Clinton already committed the=
=20
federal government to that course. In 1999, he signed an executive order=20
mandating that Washington expand its use of renewable energy; later, his=20
administration set a goal of obtaining 2.5% of its electricity from renewab=
le=20
sources by 2005, almost eight times more than today. Smith believes that go=
al=20
is already too low, largely because renewables are becoming more competitiv=
e=20
as conventional sources grow more expensive.
?????Even so, this initiative is already spurring new thinking. As part of=
=20
the overall plan, the Clinton administration committed to installing 20,000=
=20
solar systems on government facilities by 2010; by the time he left office,=
=20
2,000 were already in place.
?????"It's out in the national parks, where instead of having to string pow=
er=20
lines to remote buildings, they are putting up solar systems," says Dan=20
Reicher, the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy=
=20
under Clinton. "There are several thousand units of naval housing in Hawaii=
=20
that are now using solar. They are being used at the Coast Guard Station in=
=20
Boston, a post office in Nantucket."
?????Another dramatic project is underway in Nevada. Shortly before Clinton=
=20
left office, his administration signed an agreement with a private consorti=
um=20
to lease part of an old nuclear test site in the desert northwest of Las=20
Vegas as a giant wind power facility that would be the nation's second=20
largest. Eventually the site is expected to provide power for California an=
d=20
Nevada and the Energy Department itself from 500 wind turbines.
?????President Bush hasn't tipped his hand entirely on leveraging governmen=
t=20
buying power to boost renewables. Disturbingly, the national energy plan th=

Bush released earlier this month says not a word about the use of governmen=
t=20
procurement. But Jill Schroeder, an Energy Department spokeswoman, says the=

administration has indicated no intention to revoke the Clinton executive=

order--and the green power purchasing goal it includes.
?????As for the Sun Wall, Energy Department officials sound dubious--but th=

are reserving judgment until Wolf's firm completes its cost estimates. The=

By GERALDINE BAUM, Times Staff Writer

?????WASHINGTON--The National Mining Assn. represents a fuel that many=20
Americans think went out with Charles Dickens.
?????Just last week, a California congressman's aide asked an association=
=20
lobbyist wide-eyed: "Do we still use coal in this country?"
?????The answer is yes--and lots of it. More than half of America's=20
electricity is coal-fired, but polls show that most Americans don't know it=

improvements.
?????"It was like waking up every morning with a six-chamber gun pointed at=
=20
your head, and each chamber contained a lethal bullet," said Thomas Altmeye=
r,=20
the association's top lobbyist.
?????Suddenly, it's a new day for coal in America. That much became clear t=
o=20
Altmeyer the other day as he found himself at the White House, where Vice=

President Dick Cheney personally briefed about 40 industry types on the Bus=

administration's new energy plan.
?????"It was really nice to hear it from him," says Altmeyer.=20
?????A lot has changed in the short time since George W. Bush beat Al Gore =

West Virginia (and lots of other places), and California's power crisis=20
transformed dirty old coal into a fossil fuel of the future.
?????Now, when the mining association faxes position papers to the U.S.=20

coal-producing state.
?????When the Bush-Cheney team took over, mining association employees were=

invited to serve on transition teams. The White House had not had a new=20

?????Yet, like poor relatives who have finally been invited over for=20

pariah to homecoming king, the best that Altmeyer and his boss, mining=20

chuckling.
?????A coal-friendly Democratic senator slapped Altmeyer on the back at a=

Altmeyer shipped him a list of suggestions to share with his liberal=20

?????"We're not going to waste this opportunity to educate people, no way,"=
=20
says Altmeyer.=20
?????The association's president, Gerard, 42, a native of Idaho and a forme=
r=20
consultant to the mining industry, is not ready to celebrate. He is new at=

his job: He took over the NMA shortly before Bush took over the White House=
,=20
but he has been around mining long enough to remember other times when the=
=20
industry was left for dead but rebounded with an energy crisis.
?????And so, he says, he is merely "cautiously optimistic."
?????"You might sense some excitement in the industry," he allows, "that we=
=20
have a White House that recognizes the facts." He then rattles off a bunch:=
=20
The U.S. has enough reserves in the ground to burn coal at its current rate=
=20
for 250 years; since implementation of the 1970 Clean Air Act, coal use for=
=20
electricity has tripled while emissions have dropped 30%.
?????"We play an important role in society and the White House knows it,"=
=20
Gerard says. "Does that make us gleeful? Not necessarily."
?????Perhaps it's because coal is still a hard sell to many people.=20
?????Gerard is the speaker at a conference of 400 scientists interested in=

"carbon sequestration," a theoretical solution to coal's contribution to=20
global warming. But he spends about half of his time attacking=20
environmentalists and saying things like, "California represents a failed=

?????When a professor takes issue with his combative "tone," Gerard smiles=

s,=20
"Look, the professor is looking for a technical paper. That's not what we d=

I'm trying to talk about what is at stake and the future."
?????In recent years, the NMA has tried to refashion its industry's dark=20

"bunk" and more time on the bandwagon to clean up three of the four main=20
pollutants caused by its use. And now coal-related businesses are trying to=

act like winners. Besides backing Bush's $2-billion plan for more "clean=20
coal" technology, they're spending $10 million of their own money on a=20
campaign to buff up their image.=20
?????More than image-building, however, the real work of the mining=20

?????Altmeyer is a tall, strapping fellow. But, although he was born in Wes=

?????After earning degrees in law and business, Altmeyer went to work for t=

"lots of coal miners who were proud of what they're doing," he says.=20

?????Gov. Gray Davis described the state's actions--detailed in a set of=20

the commission's industry-friendly policies.
?????"This agency has failed its duties miserably," he said. "It's time for=

FERC's actions to date have failed "to extinguish the fire that is rapidly=

?????The state's filings and the evidence about wholesale prices they conta=

Bush in Los Angeles.
?????California's petitions also come the day that Bush won Senate=20

protect California consumers.
?????Since last June, after prices began to soar in California's partly=20
deregulated electricity market, Davis has beseeched the federal agency to=

?????But its commissioners have declined to cap prices across the West's=20

?????But some economists have concluded that California's market is so flaw=

?????State officials have also faulted the federal plan for exempting=20

the average price had risen more than 700%, to $258 per megawatt-hour,=20

El Paso CEO Admits Approving Subsidiaries' Natural Gas Deal=20

?????WASHINGTON--The chief executive of a Texas energy company testified=20
Friday that he approved a controversial deal between two subsidiaries that=

Police Support 48-Hour Alerts for Blackouts=20
Crisis: Law enforcement officials downplay crime fears, saying notice of=20
power outages will make their jobs easier.=20

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer


?????Earlier this year, when widespread blackouts first began to roll their=
=20
way across California, electric utility officials explained why they couldn=
't=20
give the public more than a few minutes' warning before pulling the plug.
?????Advance notice, they explained, would give the upper hand to criminals=

who could plan their day around out-of-service burglar alarms.
?????That was then.
?????This is now: On Friday, law enforcement officials throughout Southern=
=20
California hailed a decision by Gov. Gray Davis to create an early-warning=
=20
system that would give the public increasingly specific alerts during the 4=
8=20
hours leading up to a blackout.
?????"It's a huge improvement," Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said at=
 a=20
news conference, where he was joined by senior officials of the California=
=20
Highway Patrol and the Los Angeles Police Department, among other agencies.=
=20
The governor announced his plan Thursday.
?????The governor's plan was also endorsed by 35 police chiefs from=20
throughout Los Angeles County. The chiefs held their annual meeting Friday =
in=20
Palm Springs.
?????Since the blackouts began, "one of the No. 1 issues has been the lack =
of=20
notification," said Pasadena Police Chief Bernard Melekian, who is presiden=
t=20
of the county police chiefs association.
?????What gives? What has changed since January, when officials from Southe=
rn=20
California Edison insisted that they couldn't give more than five or 10=20
minutes' warning?
?????Richard Rosenblum, a senior vice president for Edison, said the utilit=
y=20
had canvassed law enforcement officials earlier this year. "The general vie=
w=20
at that time--and it certainly was not unanimous--was that for public safet=
y=20
reasons, it would be better not to release that information."
?????Since then, he said, "there's been a good deal more thinking . . . and=
=20
that view has changed."
?????Melekian (whose city is served by its own utility, not Edison) said he=
'd=20
heard that explanation before.
?????"I remember, when they were saying that, I had trouble finding anybody=
=20
who had been canvassed," he said. "I certainly wasn't. Somebody may have=20
been."
?????Were police worried about looting and burglaries in a blackout?
?????"We never were worried about that," Melekian said. With blackouts=20
lasting only about an hour in any one place and always occurring during=20
daylight, "we haven't seen any crime issues emerge and we don't anticipate=
=20
any."
?????Baca said he did have concerns, but they were erased Monday, when Davi=

=20
threat of crime during blackouts. Chicago has a plan in place for dealing=

other public places should receive the most attention.
?????The Chicago officials told the Californians that public safety isn't=

affected areas, Baca said.
?????"All of us were extremely relieved that . . . our fears about crime=20

the first rolling blackouts walloped companies last summer. Though resident=
s=20
might find it inconvenient to have their dishwashers turned off, a sudden=
=20
outage can wreak havoc on a company if an assembly line freezes or a comput=
er=20
system crashes.
?????The stakes are enormous. A Silicon Valley business group estimated tha=
t=20
a single blackout last June resulted in losses of $100 million for that=20
region's companies because of forfeited sales, squandered productivity,=20
wasted wages and ruined products.
?????A study released this month by a California business consortium=20
estimated that a projected 30-plus days of summer blackouts could cost stat=
e=20
businesses $21.8 billion, reduce household income by $4.5 billion and resul=
t=20
in 135,000 lost jobs.
?????Julie Puentes, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Business Council,=
=20
said the governor's plan is consistent with what businesses have been=20
demanding. "If they can do this, companies will be able to use the backup=
=20
generation that they've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for," she sai=
d.=20
"They will be able to prevent chaos for their workers, and they'll be able =
to=20
maintain their business operations, which benefits the California economy."
?????The president of Aluminum Precision Products in Santa Ana, which has=

four manufacturing plants in Orange County, was equally enthusiastic.
?????"You have no idea what help [the warnings] would be," Philip S. Keeler=
=20
said. "In our particular case, because of the heavy equipment, this could b=

the difference between life and death, and I'm very serious. It will help=

tremendously."
?????Others are skeptical.
?????James Swartwout, chief executive of Torrance-based Summa Industries,=
=20
said he's not counting on the system to protect his molded plastics=20
manufacturing company.
?????"How can they say with certainty that a blackout will occur?" Swartwou=
t=20
asked. "It's my understanding that they have no real way of knowing until t=

very last minute. Eventually, we'll get two or three warnings a week. I can=
't=20
promise we won't start to ignore them."
?????Indeed, while early warning sounds good in theory, implementing it is=
=20
another story. The utilities long resisted such a system because they often=

?????One of the big concerns with early warning is that it simply won't be=

President Bush wasn't on California soil for more than five minutes yesterd=
ay=20
when he was drawn into his first debate on the state's power crunch.=20
Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks who met Air Force One on t=

an animated conversation.=20
"I brought up . . . the idea that after his meeting with our governor, I=20
hoped he would be in favor of wholesale regulation (of energy prices),"=20
Sherman said later. "He disagreed with me."=20
Sherman -- who two weeks ago suggested that the headline to the president's=
=20
national energy policy should be "Bush to California: Drop Dead" -- didn't=
=20
seem optimistic yesterday about Bush's 48-hour visit to the state. "I think=
=20
that the president's policies show either a lack of understanding of what's=
=20
really going on in California, or a lack of concern," he said.=20
That vignette underscored some of the challenges facing Bush, who arrived i=
n=20
California as protesters geared up and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis prepared =
to=20
press him for federal action on the state's power troubles.=20
Besides Sherman, Bush was greeted by a crowd of cheering Republicans,=20
including Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles Mayor Richard=20

But today, Bush will sit down with the present governor, who lately has bee=
n=20
blistering in his criticism of the president.=20
"The last time I looked, California was still part of the United States of=

America," Davis told reporters this weekend. "We have contributed=20
disproportionately to the economic growth of this country. There's no reaso=

In his first visit to California since just before the election, Bush plans=

ENERGY SECRETARY ACTS
Just hours before the president landed, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham=20
ordered a speedup in planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electrici=

Abraham's holiday action was timed to provide a bit of positive news for Bu=

seek outside financing to reduce the transmission bottleneck on California'=
s=20
Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state.=20
This morning, Bush will visit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, near=
=20
San Diego, to underscore his conservation order for a 10 percent cut in=20
energy usage in federal buildings and military facilities.=20
In Los Angeles, he will deliver a wide-ranging talk before the World Affair=
s=20
Council and lead a discussion among business leaders about technological=20
advances in energy conservation.=20
Then, he will head to Fresno and Sequoia National Park to press his=20
initiative to improve national parks. Along the way, protesters have vowed =
to=20
provide a vocal commentary on Bush's energy and environmental policies.=20
But the real drama of the trip will no doubt be the sit-down between Bush a=
nd=20
Davis today. The governor pushed for a lengthy, open meeting with Bush that=

crisis, and what it wants the federal government to do -- including=20
implementing price caps on the wholesale cost of energy, cost-based pricing=
,=20
and the possibility of ordering refunds.=20
DAVIS THREATENING SUIT
The governor has said he will consider suing the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission -- the agency charged with overseeing energy prices -- if it doe=
s=20
not impose temporary price caps.=20
And the state Legislature has already filed a suit, saying the commission h=

failed to stop what it has determined are "unjust and unreasonable prices."=
=20
With California's energy woes worsening and a summer of rolling blackouts=
=20
predicted, the Bush-Davis session holds potentially deep political pitfalls=
=20
for both leaders, both of whom are suffering in state polls as a result of=
=20
their handling of the energy crisis.=20
Bush needs to demonstrate his concern for California, a state that gave a=
=20
12-point margin of victory to Al Gore in the presidential election.=20
But even as Bush adviser Karen Hughes told state reporters this week that t=
he=20
president had arrived to show he cares, Vice President Dick Cheney again=20
chastised state officials for delaying their response to the energy crisis=
=20
"because all of the action was potentially unpleasant."=20
And Cheney signaled that the administration would resist long-term price=20
caps, saying, "We think that's a mistake."=20
Such talk drew fire from Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who=
=20
charged that Cheney's words demonstrated insensitivity to California's=20
troubles and only underscored the perception of an "all-oil, all-the-time=
=20
ticket."=20
Davis, whose campaign for re-election next year will depend on his handling=
=20
of the crisis, has stepped up his criticism of Bush and profit-hungry energ=
y=20
firms, particularly those from Texas, in recent weeks.=20
And yesterday, signaling no letup, Davis' supporters made an unusual holida=
y=20
conference call to again press his case for federal action. They argued tha=

without immediate intervention from the Bush administration, the economy of=

Blinder and others argue that short-term relief -- for about 6 to 12 months=

-- is necessary while new power plants are being built.=20
"Most times and most places, I agree price caps are not the long-run=20

President Bush to press for a federal cap on energy prices.=20
But Davis wasn't expected to win any concessions during the 20-minute Tuesd=

"The president did not create this problem, but he is uniquely situated to=

While this will not help this summer, Abraham said in a statement the line=

=20
many state residents give the former Texas governor lackluster approval=20

effects of the worsening energy crunch, a new Field Poll shows.=20
The poll of 1,015 Californians, taken from May 11 to May 20, shows that 42=
=20
percent approve of Bush's job performance to date, with 40 percent=20
disapproving, a nearly even split. Eighteen percent of those surveyed offer=

no views of Bush's performance, the poll showed.=20
A Field Poll last week showed that on energy issues specifically, more than=

half of Californians viewed the president's job performance as "poor" or=20
"very poor," compared with 38 percent who gave Democratic Gov. Gray Davis t=

"This should be a time when Bush is enjoying his honeymoon period," said Ma=

DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, who pronounced the president's ratin=

"very mixed."=20
"If you compare Bush's 42 percent approval ratings in California, it's abou=

In the Field Poll's first measure for Bush since his election, "what stands=
=20
out is the absence of any real honeymoon."=20
". . . It's highly partisan," DiCamillo said.=20
CHENEY LOOKS RATHER POSITIVE
Vice President Dick Cheney fares better, with 47 percent of Californians=20
viewing him in a positive light and 25 percent disapproving.=20
Much of the difference in the ratings comes because voters are not as likel=
y=20
to hold the second-in-command responsible for their energy woes, DiCamillo=
=20
said.=20
"Whenever there's a problem with the federal government, you're going to=20

=20
"Bush will be held responsible for his administration."=20
DAVIS' SHARP DECLINE
The Field Poll reported last week that as the energy crisis has ramped up,=
=20
the governor's overall approval ratings have fallen statewide. Today, 49=20
percent disapprove of his job performance and 42 percent approve -- a sharp=
=20
decline from the favorable approval ratings he held in January.=20
But the new poll shows that the public's views of the Legislature has dropp=

dramatically in recent months as concerns about the energy crisis have=20
multiplied. Just 39 percent of Californians have a positive view of the=20
Legislature's job performance today, while 42 percent have a negative view.=

That's a stark contrast to January, when residents approved of the job the=
=20
Legislature was doing by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, 52 percent to 25 percent=
.=20
While state and local political leaders appear to bear the brunt of the=20
public's negative feelings regarding the recent energy crisis, Californians=
=20
continue to give strong approval ratings to their two U.S. senators and to=
=20
members of Congress, the poll showed.=20
Californians hold favorable views of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was re-=20

=20
doing, the latest poll showed.=20
"She has always had good job ratings" among voters, said DiCamillo, "and th=
is=20
is just an affirmation of that."=20
Sen. Barbara Boxer also continues to get high ratings, with 49 percent=20
approving of her performance and 28 percent disapproving. And Californians=

with 53 percent approving and 35 percent disapproving.=20

An 11th-hour proposal to help ease Nevada's budget problems and provide mor=
e=20
electrical power to neighboring California was outlined Monday by a key sta=
te=20
lawmaker.=20
Assembly Ways and Means Chairman Morse Arberry, D-Las Vegas, said his plan,=
=20
to be introduced Tuesday, would allow power plants to be built along the=20
Nevada-California border, on land that would be owned by this state.=20
"It could produce millions of dollars for the state," said Arberry, adding=
=20
that he has asked researchers to determine the exact dollar benefit to Neva=
da=20
to help get the proposal passed in the final week of the 2001 session.=20
Under the proposal, the state would negotiate with the federal Bureau of La=
nd=20
Management to acquire BLM land on the border of the two states, especially =
in=20
the southern Nevada desert region.=20
The state then could accept bids from companies that wanted to build=20
power-generating plants, and take the bid that would be the best deal for t=
he=20
state, he said.=20
The benefit to the power plant builders would be a site as close to a prime=
=20
market -- energy-starved California -- but located in industry-friendly=20
Nevada, which already has moved to speed up paperwork involved in power pla=
nt=20
approvals.=20
Arberry said he wasn't approached by energy company lobbyists to introduce=
=20
the idea. Instead, he said, "I was just talking to an old guy at the=20
barbershop, and he suggested it. I don't know if he even realized what he w=
as=20
saying."=20
As part of a broad effort to ensure Nevada has enough energy, Gov. Kenny=20
Guinn already has worked with local government officials, especially in=20
southern Nevada, to speed up power plant permit processes.=20
Legislative efforts include SB362, which lets various local and state=20
agencies act simultaneously on permits for power plants, transmission lines=

and other related facilities.=20
Various power companies have come up with plans for Nevada plants that woul=

crisis. ``That's been kicked around for a while,'' he said.=20
Davis said last week he was prepared to ``go to court'' if Bush failed to=

California should try true deregulation=20
Moving toward a government monopoly is the wrong prescription




EDWARD R. MULLER=20
Mr. Muller is the former president and CEO of Edison Mission Energy, a=20
power-producing firm owned by Edison International and headquartered in=20
Irvine. This was co-authored by S. Linn Williams, former senior vice=20
president of Edison Mission Energy.=20

Capitalism won the Cold War because of better economics: Consumers make=20
better decisions than politicians, central planners or monopolists. That=20
lesson seems to have been learned better by those who lost the war than by=
=20
those who won it.
The failure to absorb the lesson is nowhere clearer than in the efforts to=
=20
deregulate utilities. Deregulation, we are being told, has failed. The ligh=
ts=20
are going out in California, and now politicians, governments, consumer=20
groups and the utilities themselves are rushing to hang out signs that read=
=20
"Capitalism doesn't work here."=20
Principles matter, so let's start with some: The objective of government is=
=20
to provide a framework for a better life for its people, and monopolies are=
 a=20
bad framework. They are inefficient, and when they include the government,=
=20
whether as owner or comprehensive regulator, they are both inefficient and=
=20
dogmatic because politics enters the equation. We pay for that inefficiency=
=20
through higher taxes or higher prices.
We must, of course, keep the lights on to maintain our standard of living.=
=20
Does that mean that we just have to put up with the inefficiencies of=20
government-supported monopolies as a necessary evil to assure that importan=
t=20
services are available? We do not. The problem has not been too little=20
regulation, but too much. California is an excellent example.=20
What has gone wrong? The finger pointing has been great sport, but the core=
=20
of the problem is just the law of supply and demand. California flat ran=20
short of power. Many have wanted to build new power plants in California, b=
ut=20
the regulatory hurdles have been insurmountable. In recent times, the=20
utilities themselves said that California didn't need more power plants and=
=20
fought to stop the construction of new plants by others. The marketplace=20
didn't fail; regulation failed.=20
And California's vaunted "deregulation" was in reality just a botched=20
substitution of one form of regulation for another. When you deregulate a=
=20
monopoly marketplace, you want all buyers and sellers to be subject to mark=
et=20
forces. What California called "deregulation" didn't come close. First, the=
=20
state and the utilities agreed on fixed retail prices for five years.
As a result, consumers used electricity without knowing what it really cost=
=20
to produce. Second, the state and the utilities agreed that the utilities=
=20
would buy wholesale power through a system subject to market forces. As a=
=20
result, the cost of power bought by the utilities fluctuated even though th=
e=20
price they could charge was fixed.
The utilities thought the retail prices were fixed high enough to more than=
=20
cover what they expected power to cost them. For two years they were correc=
t=20
and bought power for much less than the fixed prices they charged their=20
customers, but last year the cost of power soared way above the fixed price=
s.=20
This wasn't deregulation, just another form of regulation. There were no=20
principles, just political expediency.=20
It didn't take long for economic reality to assert itself and the jury-rigg=
ed=20
structure came tumbling down. Blackouts, high prices and insolvent utilitie=
s=20
are not a failure of the marketplace; the marketplace never got a chance. N=
ow=20
we are at a fork in the road. Should we go back to the regulation of the pa=
st=20
or forward to full deregulation?=20
It's not fair to say that deregulation has failed. After all, we haven't=20
tried it yet. We should return to first principles: Deregulate properly by=
=20
making all aspects of the system subject to market forces. True deregulatio=
n=20
would include:=20
* Reducing the regulatory burdens on building new power plants.
* Eliminating fixed prices.=20
* Making sure that there are enough players in the market to make it=20
competitive.=20
* Having shareholders, not customers, be responsible for the financial=20
effects of business decisions.=20
Prices will vary with supply and demand and may rise at the outset until=20
supply is added, but over time a deregulated market will give customers the=
=20
lowest prices. The talk of a retreat to the regulation of the past is in pa=
rt=20
a result of our failure to articulate why capitalism won the Cold War and=
=20
competition makes the world a better place.=20
The tendencies of politicians to intervene, and of businessmen to ask=20
government to exempt their particular business from the marketplace, or som=
e=20
of its effects, remain strong. Ironically, prosperous times reinforce those=
=20
tendencies by masking their effects on the rest of us. Whether in good time=
s=20
or in bad, the public interest is a David to the Goliath of politicians,=20
bureaucrats and businessmen who see governmental protection as safer for=20
themselves than the hurly burly of competition.
Capitalism, like democracy, is imperfect, but both are far preferable to th=
e=20
alternatives. Our laws and regulations should provide the structure for a=

marketplace where consumers vote many times a day, not a discredited and=20
dictatorial system in which only politicians and monopolists get to vote.=

Power generators and traders are finally realizing that the phrase "build i=

You can build all the new capacity you want=01*but if you don't have the na=

"What goes around comes around in this business," said Edward Tirello Jr.,=

managing director and senior power strategist-investment banking at Deutsch=
e=20
Banc Alex. Brown. "The utilities used to own the various fuel sources, coal=
,=20
natural gas, and now they are getting back into it."=20

"Oil and natural gas firms are rebundling, reintegrating, but in an=20
unregulated sense," said John Olson, an energy analyst in Houston with=20
Sanders Morris Harris.=20

Can't burn paper in a turbine
With volatility as much a part of deregulation as mergers and acquisitions,=
=20
no power producer wants to be caught with its assets unproductive, i.e. wit=
h=20
a shiny, new combined-cycle plant and no gas to fuel it.=20

"You can't put paper in a pipeline; you can't burn paper in a turbine," sai=
d=20
Donato Eassey, head of natural gas analysis for Merrill Lynch in Houston,=
=20
Texas.=20

"There are developing some real physical concerns for getting natural gas,=
=20
and we will see some reneging on deals=01*even with contracts."=20

Olson has done the mathematics concerning the spike in demand related to ne=
w=20
plants=01*and the numbers don't work.=20

"To feed all the plants expected to come on-line in the next few years woul=
d=20
take an additional 13 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd), and we are produci=
ng=20
52 Bcfd," according to Olson. "Gas production has only been growing at a ra=
te=20
of 0.4 Bcfd over the last 10 years=01*and well productivity has been down t=
he=20
last two years. We've simply been replacing our natural declines."=20

Control what's there
To put it in the vernacular: If enough gas isn't going to be there, you=20
better control what you can. Thus, Calpine Corp. in February announced a de=
al=20
to acquire for $1.2 billion in stock and assumed debt the Calgary, Alberta,=
=20
Canada-based exploration and production (E&P) firm Encal Energy Ltd.=20


No power producer wants to be caught with a shiny, new combined-cycle plant=
=20
and no gas to fuel it.=20

The deal gave Calpine a solid foothold in satisfying part of its seemingly=
=20
insatiable need for natural gas fuel, as it marches toward 70,000 MW of=20
capacity within the next three years. With Encal, San Jose, Calif.-based=20
Calpine's proven and probable reserves jumped to 1.7 trillion cubic feet=20
(Tcf), with a daily production capacity of 390 million cubic feet equivalen=
t=20
(MMcfe).=20

Earlier this month, Williams Cos. pushed oil behemoth Royal Dutch/Shell Gro=
up=20
out of the way and snared independent E&P player Barrett Resources Corp. fo=
r=20
$1.5 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt.=20

Williams' offer was music to Barrett shareholders' ears: At $73 per share,=
=20
the price was some 60% above Barrett's stock price the day before Shell's=
=20
unsolicited bid became a hostile offer in March.=20

Two weeks ago, another independent E&P player took the money and ran. San=
=20
Francisco-based HS Resources agreed to $66 a share=01*a 24% premium=01*$1.7=
 billion=20
in cash, stock and assumed debt from Kerr-McGee Corp. Not bad for a stock=
=20
trading around $20 a year ago=01*and around $5 a share in early 1999.=20

As was the case with Calpine's swallowing of Encal, Williams and Kerr-McGee=
=20
were thinking one thing when they bid the roof off: natural gas reserves.=
=20
Williams' proven reserves, including Barrett, more than doubled to 3.3=20
trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), while average daily production jumpe=
d=20
to 555 MMcfe.=20

Kerr-McGee gains via the HS Resources deal 1.3 Tcfe, about a 77% increase,=
=20
while daily production will climb 45%.

"Williams looked at Barrett using wellhead-to-power plant economics,"=20
according to Stuart Wagner, a principal in the Denver office of investment=
=20
banking firm Petrie Parkman. "It was looking at long-lived, low-risk=20
reserves."=20

More deals a no-brainer
Generators today cannot take the chance natural gas will not be available=
=20
when that 500-MW or 1,000-MW plant is set to be primed.=20

"If you are building the plants and you don't have the gas, you are down th=
e=20
tubes," Merrill Lynch's Eassey said. "If you are down a day in this market,=
=20
you're sunk. And buying gas in the ground is cheaper than buying it on the=
=20
market."

"The firms already have a market for their power, now they are locking in=
=20
margins," said Phillip Pace, an energy analyst in Houston with Credit Suiss=
e=20
First Boston. "It depends on how short you want to be. One hundred percent=
=20
short=01*you don't want to be."=20

Thus, there will be more plays made for sister firms to Barrett and HS=20
Resources, industry watchers believe. The acquisition of independent E&P=20
players is heating up.=20

"Will we see more deals? That's a no-brainer," said Merrill's Eassey. "You=
=20
think Equitable (Pittsburgh, Pa.-based Equitable Resources Inc., the larges=
t=20
holder of gas in the Appalachian region) is trading around $80 a share on i=
ts=20
fundamental valuation? That's not fundamentals=01*that's takeout."=20

National Fuel is another takeout target, said Eassey. Another analyst, who=
=20
requested anonymity, believes Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., Louis=20
Dreyfus Natural Gas and Burlington Resources are choice targets. Petrie=20
Parkman's Wagner sees Mitchell and Western Gas Resources Inc. as takeout=20
material.


Olson calls Mitchell his "dream" acquisition. The 55-year-old firm, founded=
=20
by 81-year-old wildcatter George Mitchell, may be the choicest plum still t=
o=20
be picked. Mitchell put his firm on the block last year but has yet to hear=
=20
numbers he likes.=20

"Gas production at Mitchell is up 25% this year, and is projected at 20%=20
through 2003," Olson said. "It's finding very rich gas in the Barnett=20
Formation in North Texas, but even if you're finding it at 70 cents per Mcf=

(thousand cubic feet), if you can sell it for $4 to $5 per Mcf, that works.=
"=20

Proven gas reserves are in the 1.5 Tcf range, with daily production of=20
roughly 340 MMcfd. Mitchell's stock price has more than doubled in the last=

year, closing May 23 at $56.55.=20

A crowded field of acquirers

Credit Suisse's Pace said the field of potential acquirers could be crowded=

			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig "Speedy" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M"tt"l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M"tt"l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M"tt"l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

FULL EMAIL BODY:
Clement:  We have an add'l issue on the LM  6000's and that is on IDC.  My 
understanding is when we originally structured the sharing of the West LB 
interim interest, we were assuming the turbines would move out of the 
facility to Project Facilities.  Since we have turbines that do not have 
homes, but will continue to incur add'l IDC, we would like to agree on a new 
methodology for accruing IDC per turbine.  We look forward to meeting with 
you soon to discuss this.  Let me know when you are available.  

Thanks, Thomas.

Matt:  thanks for the memo.  
As per my discussions with Billy, there is no problem with Austin being on 
balance sheet because we are accounting for our interest as a % of the J.V.  
and will accrue income, not Fair Value it.  
As to the turbine/West L.B. structure moving forward, I have left a message 
with Bruce Golden recommending in our next meeting we include the 
Procurement/Purchasing agent from NEPCO who would be involved in any 
ancillary purchases.  Additionally, accounting should be represented.  

Let us know when next week will work for you.  Thanks, Thomas.

Subject: LM6000 spending vs West LB budget

Ben,

I want to further discuss a few issues that arose from yesterday's LM6000 
budget meeting. When structuring the Acquisition and Development Agreement 
(ADA) for the LM6000s with West LB, a spending budget for major equipment 
purchases was put together and signed off by Mike Miller and Chris Booth 
which included ancillary equipment items, such as transformers but also 
chillers, stacks and compressors, etc, through November 12, 2000. What I 
heard in yesterday's meeting is that related to the LM6000's, NEPCO plans to 
order not just major equipment but smaller items too.   We need to ensure 
that  (1) the ADA as currently drafted allows for non-major items and (2) 
those items have been budgeted. We will get back to you related to (1).   

More generally, accounting has told us that NEPCO cannot pay directly for ANY 
(big or small) hard costs for which it is not reimbursed (this includes items 
for City of Austin until their units and associated ancillary equipment are 
removed from the West LB structure). Specifically, that means NEPCO must  (1) 
have a contract for all of the items (big or small) it plans to purchase on 
behalf of West LB as its acquisition agent (Kay please provide such language 
to Bruce Golden - he has informed me about an SCR LOI out there) and (2) have 
it in the West LB budget.  It would be helpful if CTG could coordinate with 
NEPCO so that all binding LOIs or contracts be reviewed ahead of time by 
accounting and finance to ensure off-balance sheet treatment. 

I will ask my assistant to put together another meeting to further discuss 
the purchase process and that the current West LB budget truly reflects what 
NEPCO plans to purchase on behalf of West LB.

Thanks,
Matt
