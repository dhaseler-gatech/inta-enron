===== ENRON KEY FRAUD EMAIL ANALYSIS =====

This file contains the 5 most significant emails providing evidence of Enron's financial fraud, specifically related to Special Purpose Entities (SPEs), off-balance-sheet financing, and accounting manipulation.

EMAIL #1: JEDI II and Special Purpose Entities
From: travis.mccullough@enron.com
To: alan.aronowitz@enron.com, peggy.banczak@enron.com, sandi.braband@enron.com
Date: Mon, 16 Apr 2001 12:05:00 -0700 (PDT)
Subject: Reminder re: JEDI II and Merchant Assets
Fraud Score: 84.6

ANALYSIS:
- Contains SPE references: raptor, jedi, spe
- Contains financial terms: structured finance
- Identifies key personnel responsible for SPEs

FULL EMAIL BODY:
A significant number of our merchant investments are owned in whole or in 
part through various structured finance vehicles.  Amendments, 
restructurings, dispositions, follow-on investments and other significant 
transactions related to those assets may be prohibited or may require 
internal or external consents.  As the commercial teams may not always be 
familiar with these vehicles or the special considerations that may apply to 
these vehicles, you may want to confirm with the attorney/legal assistant 
that is most familiar with the particular vehicle that (i) the appropriate 
people are "in the loop" with what you are doing with the asset, and (ii) 
that there won't be any unpleasant surprises (like a required consent that 
has not been obtained) five minutes before you are supposed to close whatever 
transaction you are working on.

The contacts for the most active vehicles are:  

JEDI - Jordan Mintz
JEDI II -- Joel Ephross, Shirley Hudler
Raptor and Trutta -- Joel Ephross, Lisa Mellencamp, Mary Cook
Merlin -- Anne Koehler 
Rawhide -- Mary Heinitz, Brenda Funk
Hawaii -- Gareth Bahlmann

EMAIL #2: Raptor SPE and JEDI Manipulation
From: david.delainey@enron.com
To: mike.jakubik@enron.com
Date: Thu, 11 May 2000 07:32:00 -0700 (PDT)
Subject: Re: Raptor
Fraud Score: 75.6

ANALYSIS:
- Contains SPE references: raptor, jedi
- Contains financial terms: debt, equity
- From key executive(s): delainey
- Explicitly acknowledges accounting vs. economic reality difference

FULL EMAIL BODY:
That may work -  I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked 
hard to eliminate. Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we 
took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant 
real value. Will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from JEDI 
incorporate the write downs we think should occur?

Dave, I assume you are asking how we hedge the portion of JEDI II investments 
that will come back to us after the restructuring. As any buyout price for 
CALPERS will reflect the state of the assets at closing, I think we are well 
hedged until the closing of the restructuring. We can see if we can reserve 
some Raptor capacity upfront to hege us moving forward from the restructuring 
closin. If this does not answer your question, let me know.    Mike

EMAIL #3: Off-Balance Sheet Financing
From: laura.luce@enron.com
To: edie.leschber@enron.com
Date: Wed, 13 Dec 2000 02:54:00 -0800 (PST)
Subject: Re: Hot List Items
Fraud Score: 79.2

ANALYSIS:
- Contains SPE references: spe
- Contains financial terms: million, loss, off-balance, mark-to-market
- Explicitly discusses off-balance sheet financing

FULL EMAIL BODY:
Edie,
I have left the following (in part) on Roger Ondreko's voice mail last week.  
Here is the wrap-up for the remainder of Q'4.

Chicago-/Origination/Hub/Trading - $1.7MM (down from $2.8MM)
 Two transactions have been terminated as follows:  1) QNT Management with 
PGL/NS - Proceeds mark to market were to be $480,000 to Enron.  Due to recent 
filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission on affiliate transactions, it 
was deemed that this transaction may bring too much scrutiny to enovate.  For 
2000, approximately 80% of business to PGL/NS are being transacted with 
either ENA, EMW or enovate.  Net loss $480,000 mark-to-market with potential 
accrual value in the $100,000 to $500,000 range.  2)  LS Power Plant - At 
execution stage for fuel balancing for combined cycle power facility with 
both Williams and LS who were both deemed as counterparties on transaction.  
Williams' board of directors did not approve the purchase of facility and LS 
has now sold to NRG (November 7, 2000).  Transaction now becomes a 2001 deal 
with high probability of closure.  Net loss of 4th quarter mark-to-market 
$1.5MM and accrual upside.  3)  Off-Balance Sheet Financing/Gas Supply 
Receivable - Due to cash short fall for PEC, ENA was to extend $50MM of 
receivables for 2 months under the ENA/PGL gas supply agreement through an 
Enron Global Finance off-balance sheet vehicle.  ENA was to receive 200 basis 
points of origination, netting $165,000 to Chicago, with no negative cash 
flow or balance sheet implications to Enron.

Storage Monetization - Move to 1st Quarter 2001
 Peoples Energy received short term financing to get them through their end 
of year cash flow issues, which pushes the transaction to 2001.  On the 
positive, the Peoples Board of Directors approved capital spending for oil 
and gas properties of $60MM for 1st quarter 2001 and our structure on the 
monetization provides them competitive off-balance sheet financing.  Higher 
gas prices in years 2 and 3 due to greatly diminishing backwardation in 
Chicago basis and  Nymex have increased the value of the transaction 
approximately $12MM in the past two weeks.   Value to Enron in 2001 $5MM to 
$25MM.

EMAIL #4: IBJ ISDA Master Agreement
From: jonathan.whitehead@enron.com
To: john.suttle@enron.com
Date: Tue, 26 Sep 2000 03:06:00 -0700 (PDT)
Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT
Fraud Score: 81.6

ANALYSIS:
- Contains SPE references: spe
- Contains financial terms: hide
- Contains suspicious language: confidential
- Reveals negotiation tactics with financial institutions

FULL EMAIL BODY:
John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to 
consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet 
with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

Previous email in thread:

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first. We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors. As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA." The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.

EMAIL #5: Devil's Tower and Off-Balance Sheet Issues
From: david.delainey@enron.com
To: joseph.deffner@enron.com
Date: Tue, 3 Oct 2000 06:24:00 -0700 (PDT)
Subject: Re: Devil's Tower
Fraud Score: 81.6
Email ID: 29507026.1075854435095.JavaMail.evans@thyme

ANALYSIS:
- Contains SPE references: spe, special purpose
- Contains financial terms: off-balance
- From key executive(s): delainey
- Explicitly discusses off-balance sheet structures

FULL EMAIL BODY:
Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play 
given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the 
customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility?  
Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated 
structure in the RFP?

Is this a play that you would support? 

On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso 
note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to 
quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.

How is it going otherwise?

Regards
Delainey

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE VALUE:

These five emails provide compelling evidence of Enron's fraudulent financial practices:

1. EMAIL #1 (JEDI II): Names multiple SPEs central to Enron's fraud and identifies key personnel responsible for each vehicle.

2. EMAIL #2 (Raptor): Shows a key executive discussing Raptor as an "accounting hedge" and concerns about asset values and write-downs.

3. EMAIL #3 (Off-Balance Sheet Financing): Explicitly discusses using off-balance sheet vehicles to extend $50MM of receivables with "no negative cash flow or balance sheet implications."

4. EMAIL #4 (IBJ ISDA): Reveals Enron's negotiation tactics with financial institutions and potential manipulation of credit agreements.

5. EMAIL #5 (Devil's Tower): Shows a key executive explicitly discussing off-balance sheet structures and urgency to monetize assets.

Together, these emails demonstrate how Enron used Special Purpose Entities and off-balance sheet financing to hide debt and losses from investors and regulators.
